  NAME
         axlDBCreateSymbolSkeleton - place a "skeleton" symbol instance tothe design
  SYNOPSIS
         axlDBCreateSymbolSkeleton(
             t_refdes
             l_anchorPoint
             g_mirror
             f_rotation
             l_pinData
             [t_embeddedLayer]
         )
         ==> l_result/nil
         axlDBCreateSymbolSkeleton(
             l_symbolData
             l_anchorPoint
             g_mirror
             f_rotation
             l_pinData

         ==> l_result/nil
  FUNCTION
         This function will create a "minimal" symbol instance.While the
         symbol name must beprovided, and must exist in thesymbol library,
         the instance is createdwith only pins. The pin count and numbers
         must match that of thelibrary version. Once this "skeleton" instance
         has been created, the expectation isthat you will be adding the
         rest of the symbol geometrywith additional axlDBCreate calls.
         This supports the abilityto add a symbol that has been "instance
         edited", such as is requiredby translators from other CAD systems.
         The symbol definition mustexist in the drawing, or if there is none
                 in the drawing, then it must be found in the symbollibary.
  NEEDS
         t_refdes                - The refdes of the component.
                 or
         l_symbolData            - a list of (t_symbolName [t_symbolType])
                                         t_symbolName - name of thesymbol
                                        t_symbolType - "PACKAGE" (default)
                                                        "MECHANICAL", or
                                                        "FORMAT"
                                        t_refdes - (optional) refdes
         l_anchorPoint           - The location of the symbol. Thiswill
                                        be the symbol's "origin".
         g_mirror                - nil --> not (default)
                                   t --> symbol ismirrored,
                                  'GEOMETRY --> geometry is mirrored.
         f_rotation              - The rotation angle in degrees.nil--> 0.0.
         l_pinData               - list of axlPinData defstructs for the pins
         t_embeddedLayer         - Place on embedded layer. Layer mustbe enabled for
                                  embedded. Mirror option is ignored.
                                  Layer may either be fully qualified ("ETCH/GND")
                                   or just the subclass ("GND"). May not use the
                                  top or bottom layer.
  RETURNS
         l_result - nil if not created,
                 or a list containing (car) DBID of the symbol
                                     (cadr) t if DRCs created or nil.
