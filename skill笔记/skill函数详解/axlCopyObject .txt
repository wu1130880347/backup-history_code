复制数据对象
  NAME
         axlCopyObject - copy database object(s)
  SYNOPSIS
         axlCopyObject(
                 lo_dbid/o_dbid
                 ?move           l_deltaPoint
                 ?mirror         t/nil
                 ?angle          f_angle
                 ?origin         l_rotatePoint
                 ?allOrNone      t/nil
                 ?retainNet      t/nil
         )
         ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         This supports the samefunctionality as axlTransObject
         except it copies and transform's one or more objects.
         One additional option issupported which is retainNet. This
         only applies to vias. Ifthis option is t the netof the
         via is retained on copy, nil allows the via toconnect
         to whatever it touches atthe new location.
         In the board, pins are not supported.
  CAUTIONS
         1) see axlTransObject cautions
         2) properties and attached text arealso copied.
  NEEDS
         lo_dbid/o_dbid - a singledbid or list of dbids
         l_deltaPoint - optionalmove distance
         mirror - optional mirrorobject (see above table)
         f_angle - optional rotationangle
         l_rotatePoint - optionalrotation point
         allOrNone - if t and a group of objects, transform mustsucceed
                 on all objects or fail
         retainNet - t/nil (applies to vias only)
  RETURNS
         list of transformed objects or nil if failed.

  PERFORMANCE
         If operating you need to copy a group of objectsthe
         performance is much better if you call this function with
         the object group instead ofpassing each dbid individually.

  EXAMPLES
             ldbid = list of database objects
             dbid = one databaseobject
         1) Copy a set of objects 1000 database unitsvertically
             r = axlCopyObject(ldbid, ?move '1000.0:0.0)
         2) Copy and rotate an object about its origin 45 degrees
             r = axlCopyObject(dbid, ?angle 45)
         3) Copy and rotate an object about a rotatepoint
             r = axlCopyObject(dbid, ?angle 45 ?origin 100:100)
