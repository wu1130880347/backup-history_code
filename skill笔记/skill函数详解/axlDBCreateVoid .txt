创建一个void
  NAME
         axlDBCreateVoid - add a void to an "open" shape
  FUNCTION
         axlDBCreateVoid(
             o_shape/nil
             r_path/o_polygon
         )
         ==> o_dbid/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Adds a void to a shape. Ifadding multiple voids it
         is recommended that you either add thevoids when creating
         the shape (axlDBCreateShape) or re-open the shape (axlDBOpenShape)
         before creating the voids.
         Only certain layers (e.g. ETCH) allow voids in ashape.
         Use axlOK2Void to determine if shape supportsvoids.
         For best performance, if adding multiplevoids to an etch shape
         first call axlDBOpenShape, add the voids then close the shape
         (axlDBCreateCloseShape).
         Unless you want the void tobe permanent, do not add voids to
         dynamic shapes. User addedvoids on dynamic shapes must
         be put on the dynamic shape(class=BOUNDARY) not on the generated
         shape (class=ETCH).
  NEEDS
         o_shape:  The axl DBID of the shape, if nil uses the openshape.
         r_path:   Existing path structure created by the axlPath functions
  RETURNS
         o_dbid/nil         - axl DBID of the void, nil if not created
  EXAMPLES
         1) Create Shape Example
         2) Add to existing shape
