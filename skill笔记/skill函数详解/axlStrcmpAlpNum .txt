  NAME
    axlStrcmpAlpNum - provides a alpha/numeric sort
  FUNCTION
    axlStrcmpAlpNum (
      t_str1
      t_str2
    ) => t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
      Behaves similar to alphalessp with one important distiction. If
      both strings end in the number the number portion is seperated
      and the 2 stripped strings are first compared. If they are equal then
      the number sections are compared as numbers (not strings).
      So alphalessp would sort strings to U1 U10 U2. This interface
      sorts them as U1 U2 U10.
  NEEDS
      t_str1, t_str2 - two strings
  RETURNS
      0: if two strings are equal
      +num: if t_str1 is greater then t_str2 (1 goes after 2)
      nil if t_str1 is less then t_str2 (1 goes before 2)
  SEE ALSO
      sort, sortcar, lessp, alphalessp
  EXAMPLES
         l = '("U5" "U10" "U1" "U5" "U2")
         sort(l 'axlStrcmpAlpNum)
         ==-> ("U1" "U2" "U5" "U5" "U10")
