  EXAMPLES
         1) The following example first definesthe string-valued property
           "myprop" then adds it to the net "ena2," then deletes theproperty
           from the net.
           axlDBCreatePropDictEntry(
                 "myprop", "real", list( "pins" "nets" "symbols"),
                 list( -50. 100), "level")
           axlClearSelSet()
           axlSetFindFilter(
                 ?enabled '("NOALL" "ALLTYPES" "NAMEFORM")
                 ?onButtons "ALLTYPES")
           axlSingleSelectName( "NET" "ENA2")
           axlDBAddProp(axlGetSelSet(), list("MYPROP" 23.5))
                ==> ((dbid:2421543) nil)
           axlShowObject(axlGetSelSet())
         The SHOW ELEMENT dialog boxappears, with the MYPROPvalue at
         "23.50 0000 level."
         2) Now use axlDBDeleteProp to delete theattached property, asfollows:
             axlDBDeleteProp(axlGetSelSet() list("myprop"))
             axlShowObject(axlGetSelSet())
         The Show Element form showsthe net with "MYPROP" deleted.
         3) Set DRC_UNROUTED_MINPROP on designroot
             axlDBAddProp(nil, '(DRC_UNROUTED_MINPROPt))
