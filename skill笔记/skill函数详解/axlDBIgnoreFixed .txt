禁用固定性能测试
  NAME
     axlDBIgnoreFixed - disable fixedproperty testing
  SYNOPSIS
     axlDBIgnoreFixed(
         [g_ignore]
     ) -> t/nil
  FUNCTION
     This provides similarfunctionality to that offered by many
     Allegro batch programs which allows FIXED and LOCKED property
     to be ignored (e.g. netrev -z).
     If g_ignore is t FIXED testing isignored, nil restores
     FIXED testing. No argumentreports the current state
     of FIXED testing.
     This does NOT disable READ-ONLYstates. A parent
     can be locked which means the childrencannot be modified
     (e.g. symbols locked to preventediting of its components).
     READ-ONLY objects are typicallyseen when you are in the
     partition editor.
  CAUTION
     It is important that FIXEDproperty testing be restored.
     Allegro automatically restoresFIXED testing if your
     Skill program returns toAllegro. This includes calling
     axlShell.
  NOTE
     Recommend using axlDBCloak since that API catchesany Skill errors
     and restores the mode.
  NEEDS
     g_ignore - if t turn off FIXEDtesting, nil restore.
         no argument return current state ofFIXED testing.
  RETURNS
     old fixed (nil FIXED is enable, t is enabled)

         ; Attempt to delete it
         axlDeleteObject(p)
         ; now delete it
