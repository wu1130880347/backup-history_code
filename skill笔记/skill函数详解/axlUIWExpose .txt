         you to move one window behind another.
  EXAMPLES
         The following example:
             - Displays a window using axlUIViewFileCreate.
             - Interactively moves it behind one or more other windows
                 using the "back" selection of your window manager.
             - Calls axlUIWExpose.
         The window comes to the top above all other windows.
           logWindow = axlUIViewFileCreate("batch_drc.log" "Batch DRC Log" t)
           ; Other interactive code, possibly
           ; causing Batch DRC Log window to be covered
           ; Uncover the log window:
           axlUIWExpose(logWindow)
