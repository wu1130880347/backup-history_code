  NAME
         axlGetDieStackData - get data forspecified die stack
  FUNCTION
         axlGetDieStackData (
             g_stackArg
         )
         ==> stack-datadefstruct/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This function fetchesthe data for the given die-stack and loads
         it into a defstruct.
         Only available in SIPproducts.
  NEEDS
         g_stackArg - name or dbid ofthe die-stack to get the data for
  RETURNS
         stackData - defstruct with data for the given die stack.
         nil       -die stack does not exist or there was an error.
       defstruct fields:
         dbid                  - dbid of member
         refId                 - member name
         surface               - one of DSA_SUBSTRATE_TOP,
                                        DSA_SUBSTRATE_BOTTOM,
                                       DSA_SUBSTRATE_CAVITY_TOP,
                                       DSA_SUBSTRATE_CAVITY_BOTTOM
         depth                 - for cavity-placed dies, gives the number oflayers
                                below the surface the stack is placed.
         cavityClearance       - for cavity-placedstacks, the clearance fromthe
                                stack extents to the edge of the cavity on the
                                 lowest layer.
         cavityExpansion       - for cavity-placedstacks, the amount by which the
                                cavity grows on each subsequent layer (the "width"
                                 ofthe stadium step).
         stackHeightMin        - starting height within stack
         stackHeightMax        - ending height within stack
         rotation              - rotation angle in degrees
         extents               - unioned extents of all membersin stack
  EXAMPLE
         data = axlGetDieStackData("DIESTACK1")
         printf("name = %L,minHeight = %L, maxheight = %L\n"
                data->namedata->stackHeightMin data->stackHeightMax)
         ==> name = "DIESTACK1", minHeight = 0.0, maxheight = 496.0
