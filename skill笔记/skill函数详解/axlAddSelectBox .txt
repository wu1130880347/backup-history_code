         axlAddSelectBox(
                 [l_bBox]
         )

  FUNCTION
         Find all nonselectedobjects that intersect with the input box and meet
         the find filter criteria.  Add those objects to the selection set.
         If no box (or an incomplete box) is provided, prompt the user for
         a selection box (or to complete the box) prior to the findoperation.
  NEEDS

                   bounding box tobe used to the select figures. If l_bBox is
                   nil, the function requests two picksfrom the user. If l_bBox
                   has only onepoint, the function asks for a second point from
                   the user.

         nil             - if nothing added.

         axlSingleSelectBox does not clear the select set.
