  NAME
      axlSubclasses - list of subclasses that make up class ETCH
  SYNOPSIS
         axlSubclasses(
            t_class
            ?field s_name
            ?value g_value
         ) -> lt_subclasses
  FUNCTION
      This returns list of subclasses that make up class.
      Will function in both APD and Allegro name space.
      The field and value options provide additional filtering based upon
      the characteristics of the layer. See Allegro Skill doc
      "Layer Parameter Attributes (Allegro Subclasses)" or do
         axlLayerGet("MANUFACTURING/PROBE_TOP")->??
      to get a attributes and values permitted on a layer.
      You should map the class name via axlMapClassName if you are writing
      code for both PCB and APD/SIP as certain class names are different
      in these products.
      The base call is actually just:
         axlGetParam("paramLayerGroup:ETCH")->groupMembers
  NEEDS
         t_class - class name
         field - Optional field for filtering. If value option is not
                 present filters on basis of a non-nil value.
