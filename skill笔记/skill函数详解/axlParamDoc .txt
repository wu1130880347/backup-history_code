    name                 string          Name of film.
    groupMembers         l_string        list of layerscomprising film
    drawMissingPadAperturest/nil        Specifies the apertures thatare
                                        available to draw (fillin) the shape
                                        of any pad for which there is no
                                        exactly matching pad aperture in
                                         art_aper.txt. Notselecting this
                                        option means that such pads are
                                        not drawn.
    fullContact          t/nil           Applies to negative film.
                                        When t, a pin or via that is
                                        connected to a shape uses no flash,
                                        which causes a solid mass of copper
                                         to cover the pad. When you do not
                                        select this field, a pin or via
                                        connected to a shape uses a
                                        thermal-relief flash.
   mirrored             t/nil           Specifies whether the photoplot
                                        output is to be mirrored.
    negative             t/nil           Is film positive (nil) or
                                        negative (t).
    offset               point           Specifies the x and yoffset to
                                        add to each photoplot coordinate.
                                        If you enter positive x and y
                                         offsets, all photoplotted lines
                                        shift in the positive direction on
                                        the film.
    rotation             integer         Rotation of the plotted film image.
                                         Choicesare 0, 90, 180, and 270
                                        degrees.
    shapeBoundingBox     float           Applies to negative film. Adds
                                        another outline around the design
                                        outline, extending the shapeboundary
                                        of the filled area.This new artwork
                                        outline extends by default 100 mils
                                         in alldirections beyond the design
                                        outline.
    suppressShapeFill    t/nil           Area outside the shapes is not
                                        to be filled on a negative film.
                                        You must replace the filled
                                        areas with separation lines
                                        before running artwork.
    suppressUnconnectPads t/nil          Specifies that the pads of pins and
                                        vias that have no connection to a
                                        connect line in a gerber data file
                                        are not plotted. This option applies
                                        only to internal layers and to pins
                                        whose padstack flags the pads as
                                        optional.
                                        Selecting this button alsosuppresses
                                        donut antipads in raster based
                                        negative artwork.
                                        See additional cautions in doc for
                                         artwork paramform.
    undefineLineWidth    float           Determines the width of any line
                                        that is 0.
    useApertureRotation  t/nil           Specifies whether or not to
                                         use theaperture rotation.
    vectorBasedPad       t/nil           raster artwork uses gerber
                                        behavior to determine which
                                        type of pad to flash
