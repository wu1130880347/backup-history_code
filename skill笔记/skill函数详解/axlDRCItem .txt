获取 DRC 列表
  NAME
         axlDRCItem - Performs a DRCcheck on provided dbid(s)
  FUNCTION
         axlDRCItem (
               g_mode
               o_dbid/lo_dbid
         ) -> x_cnt/lo_drcDbid/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Performs a DRC check on theindicated item(s). The dbid
         may be any dbid type (except the design). If the same item
         appears multiple times in the list then the same DRC error(s)
         will be returned and the count is the sum oferrors created
         by each dbid.
         Has two return options controledvia g_mode option
            nil: return DRC error count
            t:   return list of DRC errors
         This obeys current DRC modesettings which includes the
         master DRC on/off switch.
         Due to Waive and Duplicate DRC suppression processingthe list of
         DRCs returned usingg_mode=t may be less then the count returned
         by g_mode=nil.
         
  CAUTIONS
         - This is not an efficient way ofdoing a batch DRC.
         - This is not an efficient method of doing "what if" checks.
  NEEDS
         g_mode: t return list of DRCs, nil return count
         o_dbid: A single
  RETURNS
         x_cnt: Returns number oferrors associated with list of items
         lo_drcDBid: list of DRC dbids
         nil: no dbids (if g_mode=t) or error in arguments

  EXAMPLES
         1) Run a drc check on a net nameed "GND"
             db = axlDBFindByName('net "GND")
             cnt = axlDRCItem(nil p)
