  NAME
         axlStringCSVParse - parse a csv line
  SYNOPSIS
         axlStringCSVParse(
                 t_string
                 [g_stripWhite]
         ) -> lt_string/nil
  FUNCTION
         Parses a comma delinated line (typical from Excel). This differs from the
         Skill parseString function in several areas which make it compatible with
         Excel csv file format:
           - parseString ignores two adjecent commas.
           - if a comma is contained within a cell, Excel quotes the cell.
             parseString treats this as two cells.
           - correctly processes double quotes in a cell.
  NEEDS
         t_string - a csv string
         g_stripWhite - option to strip leading and trailing white space from
                 each output string. Default is to leave whitespace
  RETURNS
         lt_string  - list of strings parsed based on comma separator.
         nil - error (unlikely to happen)
  SEE ALSO

         - properly parse a csv file
             ret = axlStringCSVParse("a,,c,\"d,e\"" )
                 -> ( "a" "" "c" "d,e")
