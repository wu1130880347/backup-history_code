创建一条path
  NAME
         axlDBCreatePath - add a "path" (line or cline) to the database
  FUNCTION
         axlDBCreatePath(
             r_path
             [t_layer]
             [t_netName]/['line]
             [o_parent]
             [lo_props]
         )
         ==> l_result/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Creates a path figure (line or cline). axlDBCreatePath does not add
         a net name to etch when the etch is not connected to a pin, via, or
         shape. If etch is added, it ties to thefirst net it touches,
         otherwise remains "not on anet" asspecified by the arguments
         described below.
         Clines may merge with otherclines so the result coordinates
         may be a superset of theprovided coordinates. This is not
         currenty true for line types.
         Normally if you want to attachproperties to a newly created
         object you would call axlDBAddProp after creating theobject.
         CLINEs may merge withexisting CLINEs so the object you
         end up adding properties may not match the one youcreated.
         The lo_props option dealswith the issue. You can add
         your properies when creating the CLINE and if the property list
         on your CLINE differs fromany merge target CLINEs we will
         not merge your CLINE.
         We support LINES with theinterface even though lines do not
         merge.
  NEEDS
         r_path:         Existing path consisting of thestraight-line and
                         arcsegments previously created by axlPath functions
         t_layer:        Layer on which path figure is to created. Default
                         is activelayer.
         t_netName:      Name of the net of which the path figure isto be a
                         member. Ifthe net t_netName does not exist,
                         axlDBCreatePath considers it an error, does not
                         create anypath, and returns nil.
         'line:          by default a path create on an Etchlayer will
                         create clines. When you passt
         o_parent:       dbid of object to be parent of the pathfigure
                         (symbol instance or nil for design itself). If you
                         attach etchfigures to a symbol parent, the figures
                         are not associated with thesymbol, and do not move
                         withit.  (symbol instance or nil for design).
         [lo_props]      Optional list of property name/value pairs
                         See axlDBAddProp for format.
  RETURNS
         l_result/nil:   Returns nil if nothing was created. Otherwise the
                         function returns a list:
                            * (car) list of dbids of allpath figures
                                 created or modified
                            * (cadr) t if DRCs created.Otherwise it returns
                                nil.

  EXAMPLE
         path = axlPathStart( list(100:0 100:500))
         ; create path on current defaultlayer
         axlDBCreatePath(path)
         ; create a cline path on top etchlayer and assign to GND
         axlDBCreatePath(path "ETCH/TOP" "gnd")
         ; create a line path on top etchlayer
         axlDBCreatePath(path "ETCH/TOP" 'line)
         ; have user create a two pick path onboard geometry outline
         axlDBCreatePath( axlEnterPath() "BOARDGEOMETRY/OUTLINE")
         ; create a cline path on top etchlayer with properties
         propList = list( '(FILLET t) '(TEARDROP "U1.C17") )
