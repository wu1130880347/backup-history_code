返回一条线段的延迟时间和阻抗值
  NAME
         axlSegDelayAndZ0 - return delay andimpedance of a cline segment
  FUNCTION
         axlSegDelayAndZ0(
                 o_clineSegDbid
         ) => (f_delay f_z0)/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This returns the delay andimpedance of a cline segment.
         It will return nil if segmentisn't a cline segment.
         Normally delay is innanoseconds and impedance is in ohms.
         Currently is noisy if youpass in non-cline segments.
  NEEDS
         segment cline
  RETURNS
         delay andimpedance in current mks units.
