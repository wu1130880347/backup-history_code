  NAME
         axlUIPopupSet - sets the current popup in the graphics canvas
  SYNOPSIS
         axlUIPopupSet(
                 r_popup
                 )
         ==> r_prevPopup
  FUNCTION
         Sets the active popup in Allegro. If nil is passed, it unsets the
         currently active popup.
         If this call is preceded by a call to axlUICmdPopupSet with a non-nil
         r_popup, the contents of this popup are used to control graying of
         the popup items defined in the call to axlUICmdPopupSet.  Otherwise
         r_popup is used to replace the popup entries.  In both cases, the
         popup callbacks will be replaced.
         The popup is invoked by pressing mouse popup button, this is normally
         the right mouse button.
  NEEDS
         r_popup         Popup handle, obtained by calling axlUIPopupDefine.
  RETURNS
         r_prevPopup     The popup set that was previously defined. This can
                         be used to restore the previous popup state.
  EXAMPLES
         The following example creates a pop-up with the selections:
            - Complete, associated with your function axlMyComplete
            - Rotate, associated with axlMyRotate
            - Something, associated with axlMySomething
            - Cancel, associated with axlCancelEnterFun
                 popid = axlUIPopupDefine( nil
                         (list (list "Complete" 'axlMyComplete)
                         (list "Rotate" 'axlMyRotate)
                         (list "Something" 'axlMySomething)
                         (list "Cancel" 'axlCancelEnterFun))
         You then set up the pop-up, as follows:
                 axlUIPopupSet( popid)
