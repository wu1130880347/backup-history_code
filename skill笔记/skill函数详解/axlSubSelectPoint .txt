按坐标点去除所选对象
  NAME
         axlSubSelectPoint - find object and delete from sel set
  SYNOPSIS
         axlSubSelectPoint(
                 [l_point]
         )
         ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         Find a selected object that is close to the input point and meets
         the find filter criteria.  Remove that object from the selection set.  
         If no point is provided,  prompt the user for a selection point prior
         to the find operation.
         axlSubSelectPoint removes a single object from the select set, unless
         EQUIVLOGIC is on.  In that case, it may find multiple objects, for
         example, if it finds a qualified figure (such as a pin, connect line, or
         via) that is part of a net. axlSubSelectPoint then deletes all the
         qualified figures that belong to the net from the select set. (See the
         Find Filter Options section above.)
         This finds objects within the current trapsize (axlGetTrapBox) which
         varies based upon the zoom factor.
  NEEDS
         l_point         - coordinate pair for xy location where objects are
                           to be found.
  RETURNS
         t               - if an object was removed from the selection set.
         nil             - if nothing removed.

  EXAMPLES
         To add a previously defined user property, MYPROP
            1. Select four pins in a box in order.
            2. Before adding the property, subtract the pin at 6325:3575 from
               the list, then add the following:
                 axlSetFindFilter(?enabled "pins" ?onButtons "pins")
                 axlSingleSelectBox( list(6200:3700 6500:3300))
                 axlSubSelectPoint( 6325:3575 )
                 axlDBAddProp(axlGetSelSet() list("MYPROP" 23.5))
                 ==> t
         To check:
           1. Select Edit -- Property.
           2. Select a window around all four pins.
           3. Select MYPROP from the Available Properties list in the Edit
                 Property form.
         The command displays the pins that have properties in the Show form.
         Only the three pins not subtracted from the select set have the
         property MYPROP.
