  NAME
     axlDBCreateConceptComponent - Given the Conceptdevice information,
                                  create a component in the Allegro
                                  database.
  SYNOPSIS
     axlDBCreateConceptComponent(
         s_refdes
         s_partPath
         s_logName
         s_primName
         [s_pptRowName]
     )
     ==> r_dbid/nil
  FUNCTION
     Given the Concept informationneeded to describe an Allegro device,
     create the Allegro component and return its dbid.  If the component
     definition already exists, then use the existingdefinition to create
     the new component.  If the component definition does not exist, then
     create a new definition and then create thecomponent instance.
     Concept information will comefrom a chips_prt file and, possibly,
     from a physical parts table (PPT).  The location of this information
     can be determined using thecptListXXX family of routines, which
     allow browsing through a Concept library.
  NEEDS
     s_refDes        - The reference designator for the new component.
     s_partPath      - The full path to the chips_ptr filecontaining the
                       descriptionof the desired logical part.  This can
                       be determinedusing the cptListComponentLibraries
                       function.
     s_logName       - The name of the desired logicalpart.  This can
                       be determinedusing the cptListComponentPrimitives
                       function.
     s_primName      - The name of the desired primitive.  This can
                       be determinedusing the cptListComponentPrimitives
                       function.
     s_pptRowName    - The name of the desired PPT part.  This is an
                       optionalargument, as the Concept datamay not
                       include specific deviceinformation (which would be
                       contained ina PPT).  This indicates a specific
                       row in a PPTfrom which to create thecomponent.
                       This can bedetermined using the
                      cptListComponentDevices() function.
  RETURNS
     r_dbid      - DBID of new Allegro component instance.
     nil         - If unable to create componentinstance.
  NOTE
     The actual name of theresulting Allegro device is generated
     automatically.  If using the cptListComponentDevices() function,
     then the name should have been createdalready, and is included
     in the return values of thatfunction.  The name is determined by
     the Concept library data usedto create the part.
     This function meant to be calledfrom SKILL.
