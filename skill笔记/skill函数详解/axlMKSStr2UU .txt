  NAME
         axlMKSStr2UU - Add default dbunits to string
  FUNCTION
         axlMKSStr2UU(
                 t_String
         )
         ==> t_mksString/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This provides conversionbetween a input string to a mks string
         in current database units.If incoming string has mks units
         then that is used as thebasis for converion, otherwise if
         string has no units then it isassumed to be in default database
         units.
         Conversion can fail for thefollowing reasons:
            - input string is not a legalMKS format
            - conversion willoverflow allowed database max size
  WARNINGS:
         1) Conversion betweenmetric and english units may result
         2) The return numberwill be rounded to the database precision
  NEEDS
         t_String: input string
  RETURNS
         t_mksString

         t_restrict - This optionalargument is a string that indicates class
                      andsubclass restrictions if the form contains "class"
                      and "subclass" popup fields thathave not been overridden
                      with calls toaxlFormBuildPopup.  Possible values are:
                      "NONE"         - no restrictions
                      "TEXT"         - only layers that allow text
                      "SHAPES"      - only layers that allow shapes
                      "RECTS"        - only layers that allow rectangles

                      "ETCH_PIN_VIA" - only etch, pin, and vialayers
                      "ETCH_NO_WIREBOND" - only non-wirebondetch layers
  RETURNS
         This function returnsnil on failure which occurs if:
             No interactive commandis active or the active command is
             not of the type AXLregistered interactive,
             AXL Forms codeencounter an error. See AXL Forms Func Spec.
         Upon success, r_form is returned.
