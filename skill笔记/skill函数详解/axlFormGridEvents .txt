  SYNOPSIS
         Sets user events ofinterest.  It is critical for your application
         to only set the events that youactually process since
         when enabled they will be scripted.
         Current are:
            'rowselect - puts gridinto row select mode. This is
                         mutuallyexclusive with cellsect.
            'mrowselect - puts gridinto multi-row select mode. This is
                         mutuallyexclusive with cellsect. You shuld
                         use axlFormGridSelected to determine whatrows
                         areselected.
            'cellselect - puts gridinto row select mode. This is
                         mutuallyexclusive with rowselect and mrowselect.
            'change - enables cellchange events. Use this option if you
                 have cells (check and fillin types) that allow user
            'rightpopup - enablesright mouse button popup. A popup
                 must have beenspecified in the form file.
            'rightpopupPre - enablescallback to application before
                 a right mouse popupis displayed. This allows the
                 user to modify thepopip shown to the user.
                 Also requires`rightpopup be setotherwise ignored.
            'leftpopupPre - enablescallback to application before
                 a left mouse popupis displayed. This allows the
                 user to modify thepopip shown to the user. Left
                 mouse popups areonly present in the drop down
                 cell type.
                 
         By default the grid bodyhas rowselect enabled while the
         headers have nothingenabled.
         The form callback structure(r_form) has the followingnew
         attributes that are onlyapplicable for grid field types.
                 Event           Row     Col    <Data Fields>
                 rowselect       <row>    1         No
                 cellselect      <row>   <col>     Yes (1)
                 change          <row>   <col>     Yes (1)
                 rightpopup      <row>   <col>     Yes
                 rightpopupPre   <row>  <col>     No (2) (3)
                 leftpopupPre    <row>   <col>     No (2) (3)
             where:
                 <row> - isrow number (1 based)
                 <col> - iscolumn number (1 based)
                 <Data Fields>- indicates the setting of the r_form
                         attributescurValue, curValueInt and isValueString
             (1) the communicatesthe value the data value before the
                 field is changed.The change event sends the value
                 after the field ischanged
             (2) These events aresent immediately before a popup
                 is displayed so theapplication can have the
                 opportunity to modify it. See axlFormGridEventto
                 set this and other eventoptions.
             (3) If using eventsrightpopupPre orleftpopupPre the popup
                 may be canceled bycalling axlFormGridCancelPopup when
                 you receive one of these events.
         See axlFormGridDoc for grid overview.
  NOTE
         Assigning events to a gridoverrides the previous assignment
         so the following will not work:
             axlFormGridEvents(fw "grid 'change)
             axlFormGridEvents(fw"grid'cellselect)
         Instead if you want both do:
             axlFormGridEvents(fw "grid'(cellselect change))
  NEEDS
         r_form - form handle
         t_field - field name
         s_events - see above
  RETURNS
         Returns t for success, nilfor failure
