关闭所有非永久窗口
  NAME
         axlUIWCloseAll - close all non-permanent windows
  SYNOPSIS
         axlUIWCloseAll (
         )
         ==> t / nil
  FUNCTION
         This closes all temporary windows (dialogs and text view windows).
         A temporary window is a dialog that closes if you open another
         design (e.g. brd). Via Skil,l this window attribute is set by
         the axlUIWPerm API.
         The constraint manager is currently considered a permanent
         window but this may change in future releases.
         A blocking window (e.g. File Browser dialogs) cannot be closed
         via this call.
  NEEDS
         nothing
  RETURNS
         t       always
