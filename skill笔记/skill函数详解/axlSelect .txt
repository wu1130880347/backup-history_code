  SYNOPSIS
         axlSelect attempts tosimulate the selection environment of
         allegro interactivecommands by combining all selection modes to
         selection objects in the allegro database.Automatically sets up
         the pop-up to p rovide anyof the possible Allegro selection methods:
                 * Single pointselect
                 * Window select
                 * Group select
         axlSelect does not return untilit finds something or is canceled by
         axlCancelEnterFun() or axlFinishEnterFun() called via Skill.
         You can set up thepop-up to display other options such as Done and
         Cancel, but the function alsodisplays the find options. See the example
         below.
         Before axlSelect returns, it puts in theselect set a list of the dbids
         of the objects the userselected.
         Use axlSelect when you create interactive commands that allow the user
         to select objects in thesame way as existing Allegro interactive
         commands such as move or delete.axlSelect allows the user to select
         objects using the standardmethods of mouse pick, window, and group. It
         returns when theuser has selected one or more objects or picksDone or
         Cancel, depending on thepop-up selections you set up before calling it.
         The default mode for axlSelect is selecting a single object by point,
         equivalent to axlSingleSelectPoint.
         axlSelect removes any dbidsthat might previously have been in the
         selection set when theuser first selects one or more objects.
         You must set up thefind filter to your requirements before calling
         axlSelect.
  NEEDS
         firstEventCallback      Procedure that will be called the first
                                user event occurs.  The callbacktakes
                                 noargs.
         groupMode               Default is for axlSelect to return when the
                                user make a selection.  IfgroupMode if 't,
                                 axlSelect won't return until you do an
                                 axlCancelEnterFun or axlFinishEnterFun.  You
                                perform all of your activity in popup callbacks
                                instead of when axlSelect returns.  In
                                groupMode,axlSelelect will not clear existing
                                selections.  If you want that doneafter the
                                first event,  do it in yourfirstEventCallback.
         prompt                  Prompt to the user.  Default is:
                                     "Enter selectionpoint"
  NEEDS
         None.
  RETURNS
         t/nil:          Returns t if axlSelect put any objects into the select
                         set duringthe call. The select set is a list of the
                         dbids of the objects the user selected. If axlSelect did
                         not put anyobject dbids into the select set, then it
                         returnsnil.
  EXAMPLES
         The following exampledefines a function that loops, performing the
         Show Element command oneach object selected by the user:
         (defun showElement ()
         mypopup = axlUIPopupDefine( nil
                 (list (list "Done" 'axlFinishEnterFun)
                 (list "Cancel" 'axlCancelEnterFun)))
         axlUIPopupSet( mypopup)
         axlSetFindFilter( ?enabled list( "NOALL" "ALLTYPES" "NAMEFORM")
                 ?onButtons "ALLTYPES")
         while( axlSelect()
                 axlShowObject( axlGetSelSet()))
         Although you explicitly set Done and Cancel for thiscommand, AXL also
         adds Group, Window Select, andFindFilter to the pop-up.
