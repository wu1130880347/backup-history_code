设置pad 封装类型
  NAME
         axlPadstackSetType - sets padstack type
  SYNOPSIS
         axlPadstackSetType(
                o_padstack/t_padstack
                 g_uviaBbvia
         ) -> t/nil
         axlPadstackSetType(
                o_padstack/t_padstack
                 g_type
                 g_value
         ) -> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         Changes a padstack type.
         In its 2argument mode is the same as:
                 axlPadstackSetType(padstack 'type g_uviaBbvia)
         Permits changing the type orantipads as Route Keepouts (ARK)
         via the g_type optins.
         'type
            changes a bbvia padstackto a micro via and vice versa.
            Uvia types can bemanaged seperately in the contrainst system.
            This has no effect if thepadstack is used with Pins.
            Values are 'bbvia or 'uvia.
         'keepout
            Enables (ordisables) the antipads asRoute Keepouts. This
            indicates the padstackhas been built to allow use of the
            antipad to generate theequivalent of a rko for mechanical
            pins. It has no effect if thesepadstacks are used for
            logical connections.Values are t or nil.
         Marks DRC out-of-date ifsuccessful.
  NEEDS
         o_padstack - padstack dbid
         t_padstack - padstack name
         g_type - mode (either 'type or'keepout)
         g_value - appropriatesetting (see above)
  RETURNS
         t - change successful
         nil - failed. Not apadstack, padstack not indatabase,
                 type notrecognized or padstack not a bbvia or uvia.

  EXAMPLES
         1) Change padstacknamed VIA to a micro via
                 axlPadstackSetType("VIA" 'type 'uvia)
         2) Change to supportantipads as Route Keepouts (ARK)
                 axlPadstackSetType("VIA" 'keepout t)
