                 r_form
                 t_field
                 t_label
                 g_hParent

         ) -> g_hItem/nil
  FUNCTION
         This will add an item to atreeview under parent and after
         insertAfter sibling. Ifsibling is nil, the item is addedas
         the last child of a parent.If parent is nil, the item is created
         as the root of the tree.
         Note that this is the onlyinterface to add an iem to a tree.
         axlFormSetField is disabled for Tree controls for now.
         Also note that theinterface for expanding a parenton demand
         is not worked out yet. That interface willbe provided shortly.
         Applications must hold onto the returned handle l_hItem since
         a handle will be passed asform->curValueInt when the item is
         selected from the treeview. Note that the string associated with
         the selected item is alsopassed as form->curValue. However, string
         value may not be unique and thus cannot be usedas reliable
         identifer for the selctedtreeview item.
         The tree view defaults tosingle selection mode. This means there is
         no checkbox associated withitems in the tree view to make multiple
         selections. To make a treeview item multi select, you need to pass
         one of the following valuesfor t_multiSelectF:
             nil or'TVSELECT_SINGLE  for no selecion statecheckbos
             t   or 'TVSELECT_2STATE for 2 state checkbox
                   'TVSELECT_3STATE  for 3 state checkbox
         If an item is defined to bemulti select, a check box willapear
         as part of the item. Theuser can check/uncheck (2 state) this box
         to indicate selection or selectchecked/unckeched/disabled modes
         for 3 state button. When the user makesany selection in the checkbox,
         it's value is passed to application ocdein form->treeViewSelState.
         In this case, form->curValuewill be nil.
CALLBACK VALUES
        In your provided callback function for the form, the first argument,
        form, has the following propertiesrelevant to treeviews:
  
        form->curValue   contains the label of a treeview item. Thisis
                         set in single selectmode and in multi select
                         mode when the user selectsthe item. In this
                         case result->tree.selectState will be -1.
  
        form->curIntValue  Contains the id of the selected treeview item
  
        form->selectState
                         In multiselect mode when theuser picks the
                         selection checkbox, this filed will contain:
                                 0 if selection checkboxis not checked
                                 1 if selection checkboxis checked
                                 2 if selection checkboxis disabled (3 state mode only)
                         In this case result->stringwill be empty.
  
                         In allother cases the value is -1.
        form->event
                         If eventproperty is set to "rightpopup", treeview
                         control has a popup and the user hasselected an
                         item in thepopup. In this case, form->curValue
                         is set to the popup index selected, and
                        form->selectState is set to -1. form->curIntValue
                         is set to the treeviewitem id.
                         You addpopups to treeview fields in a form like
                         any otherfield in the form.

                 - If a popup (RMB) is associated witha tree control:
                   form->event =='rightpopup
