  NAME
         axlDBGetGroupFromItem - Filter object'sgroup membership by a group type.
  SYNOPSIS
         axlDBGetGroupFromItem(
             o_dbid
             t_groupType
             [g_promoteToNet]
         ) -> lo_groupDbid/nil
  FUNCTION
         You can normally fetch the list of groups that anobject is a member of
         by using the groupsattribute of its dbid (etc. o_dbid->groups).
         This function provides additionalfiltering where you can request if an
         belongs to a particulargroup type. Depending upon the group characteristics
         an object can either belongto single group of a type or can be a member
         multiple groups of a singletype. For example, anobject can belong to
         multiple generic groups canbelong to only one diffpair group.
         The g_promoteToNet optionshould be used for thosegroups whose membership
         is limited to nets/xnets.If will promote the object provided to
         its owning xnet. If istargeted for use with diffpair and bus groups
         where we limit membership to the net'sxnet. If provides an easy way
         for those groups if given the dbid of anet to promote the id to its xnet.
  NEEDS
         o_dbid - dbid to beexamined
         t_groupType - group type name. This is thegroup type name NOT
                 the name of thegroup. In dbid terms this is group->type.
         g_promoteToNet - Promoteobject to its net/xnet and perform test on
                 that object.
  RETURNS
         lo_groupDbid - group dbids or nil if not a member of requested group type

  EXAMPLES
         In both case ashOne is ashareware utility that allows user to select
         one object (see<cdsroo>/share/pcb/examples/skill/ash-fxf/ashone.il
         1) diffpair; set g_promoteToNet to t in case net is part of axnet
                 p = ashOne()    ; select a net that is a diffpair member
                 l = axlDBGetGroupFromItem(p "DIFF_PAIR" t)
         2) generic group
                 p = ashOne()    ; create a group and select an object that is partof group
                 l = axlDBGetGroupFromItem(p "GENERIC")
