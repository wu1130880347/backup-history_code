     axlUIDataBrowse - browser dialogue for database or library object selection
  SYNOPSIS
              axlUIDataBrowse (
               s_dataType
               ls_options

           ) => lg_return
  FUNCTION
      function analyzes all objects requested by caller, passing each through
      the callers callback function, and puts them in a single-selection list.
      This list blocks until a user has made a selection.  That selection is
      then passed back the caller in a list containing two objects, the first
      of which is the selected name, which may be either a database or library
      name, and the second being the AXL DBID of the object, if it was a
      database object.

         RETRIEVE_OBJECT - when object selected return dbid
         RETRIEVE_NAME - when object selected return its name (string)
         EXAMINE_DATABASE - Initially look in database for list of objects
         EXAMINE_LIBRARY - Initially look via appropriate env PATH variable
                         for list ofobjects
         DATABASE_FIXED - read-only checkbox for database
