  NAME
         axlChangeWidth - modify width of aline or cline
  FUNCTION
         axlChangeWidth(
                 lo_dbid/o_dbid
                 f_newWidth
                 [g_invisible]
         )
         ==> lo_dbid/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Changes width of lines, clines and segments (arc and line).
         By default, only visible linesare changed. This allows layer filtering
         by temporary changing thevisible layers (see examplein axlVisibleUpdate).
         If you wish to overridethis behavior then passg_invisible=t.
  TIPS
         1) If you need to change the width ofmultiple lines, it is moreefficient
            to pass them as a list of dbids then to call this function for each dbid.
         2) Currently this does not support change thewidth of shape borders.
  NEEDS
         lo_dbid/o_dbid - a singledbid or list of dbids
         f_newWidth - new width ofline
         g_invisible - if t objects do not need to be visibleon the display to have
                 their widthchanged.
  RETURNS
         list of width objects or nil if failed.
         FAILURES:
             - an dbid is not a cline, line or line/arc segment ofa line/cline
             - illegal option types
             - transformed object isoutside of database extents
  EXAMPLES
         1) Changes the width of a cline to 20 in current databaseuse units
             ; ashOne is aselection utility found at
             ;   <cdsroot>/pcb/examples/skill/ash-fxf/ashone.il
             dbid = ashOne()
             ; pick a line, clineor segment (set find filter)
             updatedDbid = axlChangeWidth(dbid, 20.0)
