             [?symbol t_name]
             [?type t_type]
             [?silent t/nil]

  SYNOPSIS
         Compile and edit checks the current (symbol) design and saves the
         compiled version on diskunder the name t_name. If ?symbol is not
         provided, then t_name will be thecurrent drawing name. If ?symbol
         is provide as nil, then the user isprompted for the name.  This
         command uses the symbol type in determining someof the edit checks.
  NEEDS
         t_design                - The name of the compiledsymbol
         t_type                  - The type of symbol, the default is the
                                  current symbol type (see axlDesignType)
         silent                  - by default compile symbolissues
                                progress messages to user and displays
                                 alogfile on error. When t this
                                disables all messages
         silentOnOverwrite       - by default will ask user if they
                                want to overwrite an existing file.
                                When t if will silentlyoverwrite file.
  RETURNS
         t_symbolName if successful, or nil if error
  NOTE
         This function is only availablein the symbol editor.
         This is a Skill interfaceto the Allegro "create symbol" command
                 and thus has the samebehavior.
         This will void all axl dbidhandles and clear the selection set.
