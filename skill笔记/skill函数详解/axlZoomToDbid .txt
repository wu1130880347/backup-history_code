NAME
         axlZoomToDbid - Zoom to list of objects
  SYNOPSIS
         axlZoomToDbid(
                 o_dbid/lo_dbid
                 g_always
         )
         ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
       Processes a list of DBID's and centers and zooms the display
       around them. Zoom is done so object(s) extents fill about
       20% of the display.
       HINT: you may wish to highlight the objects.
       NOTE: if too many objects passed (more the about 20) then no
         zoom is done.
  NEEDS
         o_dbid  - list of DBIDS or one DBID
         g_always - if t then ignores NO_ZOOM_TO_OBJECT environment variable
  RETURNS
         t       - Something was done.
         nil     - No valid DBID's or all objects already at desired
                   display state.
