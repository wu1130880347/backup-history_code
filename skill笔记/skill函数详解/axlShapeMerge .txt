  NAME
         axlShapeMerge - merge shapes
  FUNCTION
         axlShapeMerge(
                 o_shapeId
                 lo_shapes
                g_options/lg_options
         ) -> o_dynShapeId/l_staticShapeId/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This merges shapes. Shapesmust be overlapped without the fixed
         property to merge. Allmerging shapes (lo_shapes) must overlap
         the primary shape (o_shapeId).
         Supports merging db types;shapes, rectangle and filledrectangles.
         The resulting shape willtake on the characteristics of the first
         shape. This includes shape type andproperties. Any properties on
         the secondary shapes arelost.
  TIP
         If changing type of multipleshapes or doing multiple operations
         on a single shape (e.g. convert then raisepriority) consider wrapping
         the code in axlDBCloak to batch updates.
  NEEDS
         o_shapeId - dynamic shapeid or static id.
         g_dynamic - t makeshape dynamic, nil makestatic
         g_options - Availableoptions are
                 'check - don'tmerge only perform checks for merging
                 'quiet - don'toutput any messages
  RETURNS
         nil: failure
         o_dynShapeId: the dbid ofthe dynamic shape that was converted from static
         l_staticShapeId: list ofstatic shapes that was converted from a dynamic shape.
