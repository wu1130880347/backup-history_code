创建一个封闭的shape
  NAME
         axlDBCreateCloseShape - complete (fill) an "open" shape in database
  FUNCTION
         axlDBCreateCloseShape(
             o_shape
             [g_forceShape]
         )
         ==> l_result/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Closes the current openshape and applies the fillpattern
         specified in axlDBCreateOpenShape, then performs DRC. Ifthe
         fill fails, axlDBCreateCloseShape returns nil.
  NEEDS
         o_shape      - dbid of open shape created by axlDBCreateOpenShape
         g_forceShape - by defaultAllegro creates a rectangle in its
                        database when an outline is arectangle. This is for
                        performance and space reasons. Youmay override this
                        behavior bypassing a t for this option when closing
                        a shape.
         r_fill -  shape can be filled differently then voided.  This should
                 only be done withxhatch shapes and shoulduse spacing/width
                 in power of twomultiples. We strongly discourage this option.
                 Used in place of g_forceShape.
  RETURNS
         l_result/nil:   - nil if not created, or a list containing
                                        (car) axl DBID of theshape
                                        (cadr) t if DRCs created or nil.
