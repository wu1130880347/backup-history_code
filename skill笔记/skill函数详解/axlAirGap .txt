  NAME
     axlAirGap - element air gapmeasurement, same as showmeasure command
  SYNOPSIS
     axlAirGap(
         o_item1DBID
         o_item2DBID
         [t_layer]/nil
         [s_mode]
     )
     ==> l_airGapData/nil/(s_error l_airGapData/l_errorData)
  FUNCTION
     This function finds the air gap and location betweentwo given items.
     Gap is the same as reported bythe show measure command.
     Any geometric objects; logical, group or symbols not supported
     (same as show measure). Unfilled shapesare currently treated as
     filled but this may change inthe future.
     You only need to provide alayer option whenmeasuring between
     to pin or vias (also called padcomparison). When doing pad
     comparision without the layer, we use the currentactive layer.
     The layer syntax should eitherbe "ETCH/<subclass>" or "<subclass>"..
     If you desire spacing to thespecial via or pinsubclasses;
     SOLDERMASK_TOP, SOLDERMASK_BOTTOM, PASTEMASK_TOP, PASTEMASK_BOTTOM,
     FILMMASKTOP, FILMMASKBOTTOM youshould either provide "PIN or "VIA CLASS"
     as the class name. If does not matter what ofthese two class names
     you use as both will workequally well with pins and vias. If
     you want the soldermask top spacingbetween a pin and via then use
     "PIN/SOLDERMASK_TOP".
               
     Output data is returned severalformats depending on the
     s_mode option. The defaults_mode (s_mode==nil) returns the
     l_airGapData or a nil if an error. If s_modeis t then data is
     returned as (s_error l_airGapData) where s_error is one ofthe
     following:
          t - success
                     (t  (l_airGapData))
         'NOMATCH - no subclassmatches between pin/via and object.
                    Returns object'slayer.
                     (NOMATCH (t_layer))
         'RANGE - no subclass matchbetween two the etch elements (one
                 or both must be a padelement (pin or via).  If common
                 layers exist then we return the top and bottom layer where
                 matches existotherwise returns nil:
                     (ETCH (t_topMatcht_bottomMatch))
         'INVALID - one or both elements areinvalid. Data return format:
                     (INVALID nil)
     Enhanced out (s_mode = 'enhanced) offers anyLayer airgap and
     returns a disembodied property list of:
         airGap = <spacingbetween objects> (floatingpoint)
         location1 = xy locationfirst item where air gap measured
         location2 = xy location ofsecond item where air gapmeasured
         layer1 = layer (class subclass) of where first objectmeasured (string)
         layer2 = layer (class subclass) of where second objectmeasured (string)
         isEtch = both objects of type ETCH (boolean)
     For distance between two padsthe return gap based upon theactive etch
     subclass if t_layer is nil, otherwise uset_layer to determine gap.
     If one or both pads don'texist on the layer
        - in anyLayer mode we will return the distancebetween the closest
          pad layers.
        - it is an error in s_mode=nil or s_mode=t
     For distance between a pad and non-pad element;use the layer of the
     pad that you want themeasurement if layeris not provided we use
    the active layer or the top layer of the padstack.
     If performance is a concern useanyLayer mode over enhanced output.
     The distance if objects do not share the samelayer do NOT take into
     account board thickness.
  PROGRAMMING TIP
     For legacy purposes, this interface doesnot return an air gap if
     the two objects don't share thesame layer. If you want the air gap
     any layer use (s_mode = 'anyLayer or 'enhanced).
  NEEDS
     o_item1DBID - the dbid of thefirst item
     o_item2DBID - the dbid of thesecond item
     t_layer - optional layer usedto resolve gap comparison between two
                 pin/via elements.If in 'anyLayer or'enhanced mode this
                 targets aparticular layer forcomparson. It is most
                 useful in measuringmask layer gaps.
     s_mode - return additional info to clarify error may be
         nil - default mode (objects must be onsame layer)
         t - ("full mode") return l_airGapData or if not share see above
                 (objects must be onsame layer)
         anyLayer - support anylayer measure return just gap
         enhanced - return disembodiedproperty list of additional airgap
                 criteria (see above)
  RETURNS
     l_airGapData - a list containing thefollowing items:
                     (l_airGapPt1l_airGapPt2 f_airGapDistance)
                    where:
                       l_airGapPt1is the (X,Y) point on the firstitem where the
                                  air gap is measured.
                       l_airGapPt2is the (X,Y) point on the seconditem where the
                                  air gap is measured.
                      f_airGapDistance is the distance between the two points
     nil - input data error, element 1 and 2 are the same or no air gap
           can be computed betweenthe two items. Also, if t_layer is used
           but does not specify and ETCH layer.
     s_error - See error symbols listedabove
