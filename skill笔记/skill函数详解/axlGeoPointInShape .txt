  NAME
         axlGeoPointInShape - returns if pointis inside or outside shape or a polygon
  SYNOPSIS
         axlGeoPointInShape(
             l_point
             o_dbid/o_polygon
             [g_include_voids]
         ) ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         Given a point and a shapedbid or a polygon user type this returns if that
         point is inside or outsidea shape. If shape has voids and g_include_voids
         is t then pointis outside if inside a void.
         Voids are excluded ifg_include_voids is nil.
         Will not allowhole polygons as input. When polygon holes is passed the
         following warning isdisplayed:
                 Invalid polygon idargument -<argument>
  NEEDS
             l_point             - the point
             o_dbid/o_polygon    - dbid of the shape / o_polygon
             [g_include_voids]   - Applicable only in case thesecond parameter
                                  is a shape otherwise it's ignored
                                  For shape,optional, nil excludevoids,
                                   default t.
  RETURNS
         Returns t for insideshape, nil for outsideor not a legal shape.
