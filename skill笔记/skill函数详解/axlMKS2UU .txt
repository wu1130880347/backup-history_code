  NAME
         axlMKS2UU - converts a MKSstring to current user units
  FUNCTION
         axlMKS2UU(
                 t_mksString
         )
         ==> f_value/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This provides conversionbetween a MKS string to the current
         database user units.Allowed units strings is any length
         name plus manycommon abbreviations (see units.dat file
         in Allegro share/texthierarchy for supported names).
         Conversion can fail for thefollowing reasons:
            - input string is not a legalMKS format
            - conversion will overflowallowed database max size
  WARNINGS:
         1) Conversion betweenmetric and english units may result
            in roundoff.
         2) The return numberwill be rounded to the database precision
  NEEDS
         t_mksString: input unitsstring with mks units
  RETURNS
         f_value: floating pointnumber or nil if conversion failure

  EXAMPLES
         1) default conversion (db in mils)
                 axlMKS2UU("100.1") -> 100.0
         2) database is in mils
                 axlMKS2UU("100mils") -> 100.0
         3) database is in mils
                 axlMKS2UU("100inches") -> 100000.0
         4) database is in mils
                 axlMKS2UU("100METER") -> 3937008.0
