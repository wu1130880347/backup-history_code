         axlPinPair - add or deletea diffpair
  SYNOPSIS
         Add
             axlPinPair(
                 o_pin1/t_pin1
                 o_pin2/t_pin2
             )==>o_pinpair
         Delete
             axlPinPair(
                o_pinpair/lo_pinpair
             )==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         This creates or deletesa pinpair. A pinpair consists of two pins
         or ratTs on the samenet. A PinPair consistes of two unordered
         pins. For example, pinpair u1.2:r1.2is the same pinpair as
         r1.2:u1.2
         If pinpair already exists, thenexisting pinpair is returned.
         The command fails inproduct tiers that do not support electrical
         constraints or thesymbol editor.
         You cannot create a pinpairif both pins (or ratT) do not belongto
         the same xnet.
         If the pinpair was createdvia an ecset, the ecsetDerivedattribute
         will be t. This means youcannot delete it since the pinpair
         has been created from anecset property. You must find the
         ecset(s) associated with anet, xnet, diffpair or bus and make
         the modification at thatlevel.
         To avoid garbage collectionat database save, apinpair either
         must be part of a MatchGroup or have a legal electrical constraint
         property assigned to it.Legal electrical properties are:
                 PROPAGATION_DELAY
                 MIN_FIRST_SWITCH
                 MAX_FINAL_SETTLE
                 IMPEDANCE_RULE
                TIMING_DELAY_OVERRIDE
                 RELATIVE_SKEW
         RELATIVE_PROP_DELAY isstored on the "rpd" attrbiute as a list
         of lists. The reason for this isthat a pinpair can be a member
         of multiple matched groups.See axlMatchGroupCreate for more
         infomation.
  TIP
         Using dbids is faster then usingnames.
  NEEDS
         o_pin1/o_pin2   - dbid of a pin or ratT
         t_pin1/t_pin2   - apin name (<refdes>.<pin#>(ratT names notsupported)
         o_pinpair       - pinpair dbid
         lo_pinpair      - list of pinpair dbids (delete mode only)
  RETURNS
         Returns depending upon themode
             nil: error
             t:   delete was successful
             o_pinpair: dbid ofadded or modified diffpair

  EXAMPLES
         1) Example: xnethaving 2 nets; NET1 and NET1A. This demostrates
            that pinpairs areactually stored on the xnet
              - Create pinpair usingname
                  pp = axlPinPair("U2.13" "R1.2")
         
              - Create PinPair withratT of net NET1A
                  ratTs = axlPinsOfNet("NET1A" 'ratT)
                  pp = axlPinPair("U2.13" car(ratTs))
              - verify pinpairs areboth on NET1A
                 n = car(axlSelectByName("NET" "NET1A"))
                 n->pinpair RETURNS nil
              - Now look at the xnet(NET1)
                 xn = car(axlSelectByName("XNET" "NET1"))
                 xn->pinpair RETURNS (dbid:21697512dbid:21697232)
         2) Delete all pinpairsof example 1
