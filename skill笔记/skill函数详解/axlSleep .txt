  NAME
        axlSleep - sleep nseconds
  FUNCTION
         axlSleep(
                 x_time
                 )
         ==> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Sleeps specified time.
         This is a replacement for Skill'ssleep which is actually
         provided by the IPC Skillpackage. On Windows the IPC
         sleep crashes if youcall axlEnterEvent.
         If you are using the IPCinterfaces then you should call
         axlSleep instead of usingsleep.
  NEEDS
         x_time:         time in seconds
  RETURNS
         t: all of the time
  NAME
     axlSmoothDesign
  SYNOPSIS
     axlSmoothDesign(
         lx_numPasses
     ) -> x_change
  FUNCTION
     Smooths entire design. For goodresults on complicated designs multiple
     passes are necessary. Since changesin one pass may open space that can
     be used in the next pass.Suggest 3 is a typical number although very
     complex designs can benefitfrom a higher number of passes. BUT the more
     passes the longer it will take.
  NEEDS
     lx_numPasses - list ofnumber of passes to perform
  RETURNS
     x_change - number of itemschanged
  EXAMPLE
     1) Smooth design using3 passes
          axlSmoothSetParams(list("45" -1.0 "0" 10.0 0))
          res = axlSmoothDesign(list(3))
