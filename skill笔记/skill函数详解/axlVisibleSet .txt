  NAME
         axlVisibleSet - sets visibility state for entire desisgn
  SYNOPSIS
         axlVisibleSet(
                 l_visList           
         )
         ==>t/nil
  FUNCTION
         This sets the visibility of the entire design. This is the
         complementary function to axlVisibleGet.
         This command does not visually change the display, since it can also
         be used in conjunction with the axlSelect command family to provide
         additional filtering of the database objects. If you wish to visually
         update the display, call axlVisibleUpdate after changing the
         visibility.
  NEEDS
         l_visList       - list with visibility attributes
  RETURNS
         t               - on success
         nil             - incorrect format for l_visList.
  NOTE
         If there are any changes to the structure of l_visList, you have
         to reflect them here.
