  NAME
         axlDBTuneSectorSize - tune Allegro'ssector for performance
  SYNOPSIS
         axlDBTuneSectorSize(
         )
         ==> nil/l_result
  FUNCTION
         This tune's Allegro'ssector size for betterperformance.
         Normally this occursautomatically via dbdoctor or performance advisor.
         In addition, it is doneperiodically during design open.
         Allegro's optimal sector sizechanges over the course
         of a design cycle. As thedesign becomes complete a smaller sector
         size typically results inbetter performance at a cost of a slightly
         higher memory requirement.
         Note: size is in dbunits, future releases maychange this to
         design units.
  NEEDS
         None
  RETURNS
         If tuning was requiredreturns a disembody property list with
              - old sectors
              - their size
              - new sectors
              - new sector size
         If no tuning is requiredreturns nil.
