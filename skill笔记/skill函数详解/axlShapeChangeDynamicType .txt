从静态到动态的交换形态
  NAME
         axlShapeChangeDynamicType - swap shape fromstatic to dynamic
  FUNCTION
         axlShapeChangeDynamicType(
                 o_shapeId
                 g_dynamic
                 g_msgs
         ) ->o_dynShapeId/l_staticShapeId/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This swaps a connectivityshape from static to dynamic or vice
         versa. This offers the samefunctionality as the allegro command
         "shape change type".
         Notes:
         1) Voids in static aredeleted when shape is converted to dynamic.
         2) Converting adynamic shape to static can result in the loss of
            the original boundary sincewe convert the generated shapes
            (on ETCH) to static shapes not theboundary shape.
         3) Shapes convert tostatic will have their voids maintained.
  TIP
         If changing type ofmultiple shapes or doing multiple operations
         on a single shape (e.g. convert then raise priority) consider wrapping
         the code in axlDBCloak to batch updates.
  NEEDS
         o_shapeId - dynamic shapeid or static id.
         g_dynamic - t makeshape dynamic, nil makestatic
         g_msgs - t issue errormessages if failed to convert; else be silent
  RETURNS
         nil: failure
         o_dynShapeId: the dbid ofthe dynamic shape that was converted from static
         l_staticShapeId: list ofstatic shapes that was converted from a dynamic shape.

         1) change to dynamicwith messages
            ret = axlShapeChangeDynamicType(shape t t)
         2) change to static nomessages
