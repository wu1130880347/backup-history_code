         axlColorLoad - load a color file
  FUNCTION
         axlColorLoad(
                 t_file/nil
         ) -> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This loads an Allegro colorfile (default .colextension).
         Master color file is at<cdsroot>/share/pcb/text/lallegro.col.
         File format is:
             # - comment if in first column
             #N - next line with a numberis number of colors (currentlyonly
                  24 is supported). This should appearfirst in the file
                 EXAMPLE of number format
                   #Number
                   24
             #B - next line with a numberis background color. This should
                 appear after colornumber. Format of color line must be
                 (name is currentlyignored):
                         0 <red> <green><blue> [<name>]
                 EXAMPLE of backgroundformat setting it to black
                   #Background Color
                    0      0      0       0
             #I - next set of lines sets thecolors. These should always
                 appear last in the file. Wewill read until the first
                 color number thatexceeds the color number (currently
                 hardcoded as 24) or the end of file isreached. The order
                 the colors appearin the file determines the initial
                 color [priority (highest (first) to lowest (last)].
                 Format is:
                   <colornumber> <pen number> <red> <green> <blue>[<name>]
                 EXAMPLE:
                     1      1       255    255     255    White
                     2      2      14      210    255     LtBlue
            
           <color number>:entry in color table. This is the color number
                 referenced by theallegro subclass (axlLayerGet)
           <pen number>: Usedby Allegro plot (UNIX) to control what pen
                 to use duringplotting. Not applicable on Windows.
           <red> intensity ofred to blend into color 0 to 255
           <green> intensityof green to blend into color 0 to 255
           <blue> intensity ofblue to blend into color 0 to 255
           <name> (optional) name of color, currently not used by Allegro
                         but sigxptakes advantage of the name to auto-assign
                         colors.
                 
         You should call axlVisibleUpdate to propertly updatethe display after
         you finish manipulating thecolors.
         In Allegro the color fileis if we need to start anew design at
         program startup. Openingexisting databases uses the color table
         stored in that database.New datbases created when Allegro is
         already running copies thecolor table from the previous database.
  NEEDS
         s_file: color file name to load if nil usess lallegro.col
                 if no directory pathcomponent we use LOCALPATH environment
                 variable to findthe file.
  RETURNS
         t if loaded file; nil file not found or error in loading file
