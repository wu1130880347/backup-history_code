  NAME
         axlSubSelectObject
  FUNCTION
         axlSubSelectObject(
                 lo_dbid
                 )
         ==> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Removes the dbids in lo_dbid from the select set in cumulated mode.
         lo_dbid can be either a single dbid or a list of dbids. It removes
         figures completely regardless of the selection mode.
  NEEDS
         lo_dbid:     dbid, or list of dbids to be removed from select set.
  RETURNS
         t/nil:       Returns t if it removed any objects from select set,
                      nil otherwise.
  EXAMPLES
         The following example creates a via, then selects all the vias in
         a surrounding region for deletion, but saves the one just created
         by subtracting its dbid from the selection set.
         axlClearSelSet()
         axlSetFindFilter(?enabled list("noall" "vias")
                 ?onButtons list( "vias"))
         myvia = axlDBCreateVia( "pad1", 3025:3450)
         axlAddSelectBox( list( 3000:3100 3200:3600))
         axlSubSelectObject( car( myvia))
         ==> t
         The resulting select set contains the dbids of all vias in the box
         except myvia, the one just created.
