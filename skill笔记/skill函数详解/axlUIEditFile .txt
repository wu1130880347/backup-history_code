使用编辑器编辑一个文件
NAME
         axlUIEditFile - Allows user to edit a file
  SYNOPSIS
         Allows user to edit a file in an OS independent manor (works
         under both UNIX and WINDOWS).
         User may override the default editor by setting either environment
         variable VISUAL or EDITOR.
         Windows notes:
                 1) default editor is notepad
                 2) title bar setting currently is not supported
         UNIX notes:
                 1) default editor is vi
                 2) an additional environment variable, WINDOW_EDITOR,
                    allows the user to specify a X-based editor such
                    as xedit. Title bar is not supported in this mode.
         Note in blocking mode the windows of the main program currently
         do not repaint until the file editor window is exits.
         Only axlUIWClose supportes the r_window handle returned by
         this function.
