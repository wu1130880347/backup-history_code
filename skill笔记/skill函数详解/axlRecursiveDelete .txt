  NAME
     axlRecursiveDelete - Recursively removedirectories and files
  SYNOPSIS
     axlRecursiveDelete(
         t_directory
     )
     ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
    Recursively removedirectories  and  subdirectories  in the argument  
   list.   The directory will beemptied of files and removed.
    If the removal of a non-empty,  write-protected  directory is  
    attempted, the utility willalways fail. If it encounters protected
    files or sub-directories itdoes not remove them or its parent
    directories but will remove allother objects (thus it is partially
    successful).

    if not usedwith care. For example, axlRecursiveDelete("/") could
    delete your OS and all ofyour data.
