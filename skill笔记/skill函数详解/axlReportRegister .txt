  TIPS AND RESTRICTIONS
         1) Your report descriptionstring should start with your company
            name or some other standard to keepall your reports together
            in the report dialog.Also keep the description short to
            fit within the spaceprodived in the dialog
         2) The report dialog isblocking. This means you cannot ask
            for picks from theAllegro canvas. Do not use the following
            APIs:
                 - any user pick orselection API, axlSelect, axlEnter, etc.
                 - axlShell
                 - save or open adrawing.
         3) You can invoke your own form within thereport callback but
            make sure it is blocking(use axlUIWBlock(<formhandle>))
         4) Return t if you want tothe report to display. A nil
            will not display thereport
         5) If building a contextwhere your report function is stored,
            you cannot make theaxlReportRegister inside the context.
            The axlReportRegistermust be placed in allegro.ilinit
            or the .ini file (ifbuilding autoload contextes). This
            is the same rule thatapplies to axlCmdRegister.
