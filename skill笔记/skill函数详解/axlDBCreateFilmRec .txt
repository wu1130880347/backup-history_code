  FUNCTION
    This function is most commonly called through thefilm control form's film record
    "load" option, which evaluates a call ofthe form:
    (axlfcreate t_name l_params l_vis), where:
   
    name is the name of the recordto be created, of the form "NAME"
    l_params is a list consisting of 13 numbers, form '(0 0 0 ...), which correspond to
    the "Film Options" fields in the filmcontrol form
    l_vis is the list of visible layers, each layer enclosedin quotes, space delimited,
    form '("ETCH/TOP" "VIA/TOP"...)
   
    axlfcreate makes the specifiedlayers visible and then calls this function (axlDBCreateFilmRec)
    with the filmname it was passed and the 13 numbers it waspassed as l_params.  axlDBCreateFilmRec
    creates a film record with thesespecified parameters and the layers that are currently visible.
  NEEDS
    filmname - the name of the filmrecord to be created
    rotate_code - 0, 2, 4, or 6, corresponding to 0, 90, 180, 270 degree rotation
    x_offset - film record blockorigin x offset
    y_offset - film record blockorigin y offset
    undef_line_width - film recordundefined line width
    shape_bound - shape bounding boxsize
    plot_mode - film record plotmode--boolean; 0 =NEGATIVE, 1 = POSITIVE
    mirrored - flag denotingmirroring
    supp_unconnect - indicator to not flash unconnectedpads
    draw_pad - indicator to drawpads
    aper_rot - boolean indicator for aperture rotation
    fill_out_shapes - booleanindicator to fill outside shapes.
         This is the the "opposite" of the "suppress shapefill"
         switch in the film controlform (ex:  if suppress shape fill is
         selected, fill_out_shapesshould be 0).  This is named
         this way becauseart_film_block_type structures have
         fill_out_shapes fieldsinstead of suppress_shape_fill fields.
    vector_based - boolean indicatorfor vector-based padbehavior
  RETURNS
      the name of the film recordcreated, or nil if failure
  EXAMPLE 1 (called through film control form)
    Film control form's film record "save" option iscalled.  This creates a .txt filecontaining
    the following:
    (axlfcreate "TRACE_2" '(0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1) '("ETCH/TRACE_2" "PIN/TRACE_2" "VIACLASS/TRACE_2" ))
    The "load" option is selected, which evaluates thecontents of this file, calling axlfcreate.
   
    axlfcreate changes layervisibility and calls:
    (axlDBCreateFilmRecord "TRACE_2" 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1)
   
  EXAMPLE 2
    (axlDBCreateFilmRecord "TOP" 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)
   
    creates film record TOP withcurrent visible layers and fields initialized to 0/false/default
