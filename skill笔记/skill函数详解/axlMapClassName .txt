  NAME
          axlMapClassName - return theappropriate class name based on the type of product
  FUNCTION
         axlMapClassName(
             t_oldName/lt_oldName
             [g_mapToPCB]
         )
         ==>t_newName/lt_newName
  SYNOPSIS
         This is intended if youwish to write a Skill program
         that is will run in boththe Board or APD space.
         It provides mapping fromPCB Class names to the name
         appropriate to the programrunning your Skill program. It
         allows you to write aprogram using PCB Class names and
         have it run in APD.

         When using the list ofnames mode, names that are notrecognized are

  NEEDS
     t_oldName   -- A PCB class name
     lt_oldName  -- list of names
     g_mapToPCB  -- Optional. t will map fromthe APD name to the
                    PCB names.Default is nil (PCB->APD conversion).
  RETURNS
         t_newName       --     class name based on the type of product
         lt_newName      --     list of class names renamed
  EXAMPLES
         1) in APD
             axlMapClassName("ETCH") -> "CONDUCTOR"
         2) while in Allegro
             axlMapClassName("ETCH") -> "ETCH"
         3) list in APD
             axlMapClassName('("ETCH" "ANALYSIS")) -> ("CONDUCTOR" "ANALYSIS")
