  SYNOPSIS
         This sets the current drcmode(s) for checks that fall
         into set of designconstaints. These modes control
         the DRC for that check on theentire board.
         
         To determine the set currently supporteddo a axlCNSDesignModeGet().
         This supports severalinterfaces. All checks may be set
         ('all), individual checks, (t_name), list of checks with
         a same mode
                 '(s_name ...) t_mode/s_mode
                 '(t_name ...) t_mode/s_mode
         and sets of checks via a list of:
                 '((s_name/t_names_mode/t_mode) ....)
         
         For performance reasons, changing modes or values does
         not invoke DRC. You need to manually do this. A set
         of interfaces supportsmarking changes to perform
         an minimal set of drc updatesdepending upon your changes
         (see axlCNSMapUpdate).
  CAUTION
         Future releases may add or subtract constraintchecks. The
         axl interface doesguarantee the checks returned by this
         interface will remainconstant from release to release.
  NEEDS
         s_name: symbol name ofcheck.
         t_name: string name ofcheck.
         s_mode: mode setting; maybe 'on, 'off, or 'batch
         t_mode: string modesetting  "on, "off" or "batch"
         'all: set all checks for given tier ofallegro.
  RETURNS
         Returns t if succeeds or nil if failure.

  EXAMPLES:
         1) turn on pkg to pkg ki check
                 axlCNSDesignModeSet('Package_to_Place_Keepin_Spacing'on)
         2) make all design constraints batchonly
                 axlCNSDesignModeSet('all 'batch)
         3) turn two constraint to off
                 axlCNSDesignModeSet('(Negative_Plane_IslandsPad_Soldermask_Alignment) 'off)
         4) set various constraints to differentmodes
                 axlCNSDesignModeSet( '((Package_to_Place_Keepin_Spacingoff)
                                 (Package_to_Place_Keepout_Spacing'on)) )
