基于类型设计查询约束模式
  NAME
         axlCNSDesignModeGet - inquireconstraint modes based on type design
  FUNCTION
         axlCNSDesignModeGet(
                 nil
         ) ==> ls_constraints
         axlCNSDesignModeGet(

         ) ==> t/nil
         axlCNSDesignModeGet(
                 s_name/t_name
         ) ==> s_mode/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This fetches the currentdrc mode(s) for checks that fall
         into set of designconstaints. These constraints pertain
         to the entire board. Todetermine the setcurrently supported
         do a axlCNSDesignModeGet().
         This has axlDebug support.
  CAUTION
         Future releases may add or subtract constraintchecks. The
         axl interface does guaranteethe checks returned by this
         interface will remainconstant from release to release.
  NEEDS
         nil: returns all checks indesign type DRC
         'all: returns all checks and current mode
         'editable: returns t if mode can be change, nil otherwise
                 nil is returned when in Allegro studio which does
                 not offer this option
         s_name: symbol name ofcheck.
         t_name: string name ofcheck
  RETURNS
         ls_names: - list of checks (s_name ...)
         lls_names: - list of checks and their mode ((s_name s_mode) ...)
         s_mode: mode 'on, 'off or 'batch
