判断AXL的调试模式是否可用
  NAME
         axlIsDebug - is axl debug enabled
  FUNCTION
         axlIsDebug(
         ) ==> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This checks if AXL debug mode isenabled. This is associated
         with the "axldebug" Allegro environmentvariable.
         
         When set thismode is set AXL may print additional AXL API argument
         warnings whenarguments to AXL functions are incorrect. Many
         warnings do not obeythis variable because they are considered
         serious or edgeconditions. Warnings supported are less serious
         and are known from userfeedback to be troublesome to program around.
         Typically when a AXLAPI function encounters an argument error
         it will print awarning and return nil.
         When not set thecode runs in development mode that will eliminate
         many of these warnings.
         You should have this modeenabled when developing Skill code.
         This functionality wasintroduced in 15.2. Currently few AXL
         functions take advantage ofthis option. Future releases will
         make more use of thisoption.
