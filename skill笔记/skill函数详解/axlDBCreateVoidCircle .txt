  NAME
         axlDBCreateVoidCircle - create a circularvoid in an "open" shape
  FUNCTION
         axlDBCreateVoidCircle(
                 o_shape
                 l_location
                 [f_width]
                 )
         ==> o_polygon/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Creates a circular void inthe currently open shape rd_shape. It is
         an error to call this function without a currentlyopen shape.
  NEEDS
         o_shape:        dbid of the open shape created by
                        axlDBCreateOpenShape.
         l_location:     Center and radius of the circular void to becreated.
                         Thestructure of the argument is: (X:Y R).
         f_width:        Void edge width (used by cross-hatch). Default is 0.
  RETURNS
         o_polygon/nil:  dbid of the circular void created. If thereis an
                         error, function returns
                         nil, and does not create a void.
