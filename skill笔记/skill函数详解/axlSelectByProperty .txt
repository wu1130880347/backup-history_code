  NAME
     axlSelectByProperty - selects allobjects by property and value
  SYNOPSIS
    axlSelectByProperty (
      t_objectType
      t_property
      [t_value]
      [g_regularExpression]
    ) => lo_dbid/nil
  FUNCTION
      This selects the dbid set of aparticular allegro database
      object that have the indicatedproperty.
      The property can just be aname or a name/value pair. The
      value may optionally contain iregular expression (* or ?).
      In that
      Certain select by namefunctions support wildcard characters and
      this allows you to test for theirpresence before calling this
      functions.
      The regular expression used byAllegro differ from the Skill
      regular expression handling tobe more compatible with the
      character set allowedin Allegro object names. This should
      not be used to testpatterns being sent to the Skill regexp
      family of functions
      For value matching thedatabase formats into the value string
      to contain the unitspreference (ifapplicable for the property).
      If the data type of theattribute is BOOLEAN
      and if exists on theelement the string is empty ("").
      If the data type isINTEGER or REAL,
      the user units string (if any) is appended to thevalue. If the
      data type is one of the "unitscatagory" types (e.g. ALTITUDE,
      PROP_DELAY) the MKS package isused to convert the value.
      All names are caseinsensitive.
  CAUTION
      Property names may change fromrelease to release or they may be
      obsoleted. Skill programsusing property names may require
      modifcations in futurereleases
