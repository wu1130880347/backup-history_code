从某个hole中获得一个多边形数据
  NAME
     axlPolyFromHole - Function createsa list of polygon object from hole
  FUNCTION
     axlPolyFromDB (
         o_polygon
     )
     => lo_polygon
  SYNOPSIS
     Creates a new poly from thevertices of the hole, and setsthe isHole
     attribute of the resulting polyto nil. Function returns nil in case
     of error.
  NEEDS
      o_polygon    - o_polygon on which the operation is tobe done.
                     The o_polygonmust have isHole attribute set to t
                     (that is the argument must be a hole).
  RETURNS
      lo_polygon    Returns a list of o_polygons whichrepresent the
                    resultinggeometry after creating poly from the hole
                    argument. In case of an error, it returns nil.
  SEE ALSO
     Creates an lo_polygon objectfrom a hole.
     The lo_polygon object can bemanipulated with the following operations:
         axlPolyOperation()   performs various logical operations on 2 listsof
                              polygon UDTs
         axlPolyExpand()      expands or contracts
  EXAMPLES
         poly = axlPolyFromDB(shape_dbid)
         hole = car(poly->holes)
         polyList = axlPolyFromHole (hole)
