  NAME
         axlPurgePadstacks - purge unusedpadstacks from database
  FUNCTION
         axlPurgePadstacks(
                 S_mode
                 t/nil
         )
         ==> x_cnt
  SYNOPSIS
         This purges unusedpadstacks from the database in the area
         controled by S_mode symbol
             'padstacks - purgesunused padstacks from the database.
                 when thesecond argument is nil purges all unused,
                 when t justpurges unused derived padstacks
             'via - purges not foundvias from all the via list constraints
                 under the physicalrule set. When nil just purges the
                 not foundvias. When t also purges the vias not loaded
                 in the database (but could be foundby looking on the
                 disk via thePSMPATH environment variable). The nil
                 option is NOT available from theAllegro user interface
                 which onlysupports the t method.
         For best results delete theunused padstacks from the database
         then purge the vialists.
  NEEDS
         S_mode: either 'padstacks or 'via
         option: t - purgejust unused derived padstacks, else (nil)
                 purge all
