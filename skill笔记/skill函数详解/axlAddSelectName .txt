  NAME
         axlAddSelectName        - Add objects to selection set by name
         axlSingleSelectName     - Add objects to selection set by name after
                                  clearing the current selections.
         axlSubSelectName        - Remove objects from sel set by name.
  FUNCTION
         axlAddSelectName(
                 t_nameType
                 l_names
         )
         ==> t/nil
         axlSingleSelectName(
                 t_nameType
                 l_names
                 [g_wildcard]
         )
         ==> t/nil
         axlSubSelectName(
                 t_nameType

  SYNOPSIS
         Finds figures by theirnames. Clears the current contents of the select
         set, and adds named figure dbids to theselect set in single modeusing
         the arguments as describedbelow. The function selects any figures
         completely, regardless of theselection mode.  If the function selects
         a figure already partiallyselected, the figure becomesfully selected.
         Note: The on buttons matterfor select Propertiesby name, but don't
         for other name types.   
         Both axlSubSelectName and axlAddSelectName always operate inwildcard mode.
         Both will take the optionalwildcard argument but ignore it. In the future,
         if passed nil they may obey the argument.

                         matching.Default is nil where * and ? are treated
