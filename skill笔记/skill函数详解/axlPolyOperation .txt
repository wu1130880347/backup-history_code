两个多边形数据的逻辑操作
  NAME
         axlPolyOperation -  logical on two sets of polygons
  FUNCTION
         axlPolyOperation (
                o_polygon1/lo_polygon1
                o_polygon2/lo_polygon2
                 s_operation
                 )
         ==> lo_polygon/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Performs the logicaloperation specified on the two sets of polys. Will not
         allow hole polys as input.When holes are passed as input, the following
         warning is displayed:
         Invalid polygon id argument<argument>
         Cautions:
          - This function isprovided "as-is". Result, in certain cases, may fail
            or deliver incorrectresults. No commitment can be made to address issues
            uncovered when usingthis API.
          - Underlying logicalop function failsin rare dense geometrical situations,
            nil will be returned inthat case.
  NEEDS
         o_polygon1 / lo_polygon1
         o_polygon / list ofo_polygons on which the operation is to be done.
         o_polygon2 / lo_polygon2
         o_polygon / list ofo_polygons on which the operation is to be done.
         s_operation:    string specifying the type oflogical operation, one of
                         'AND, 'OR, or'ANDNOT.
  RETURNS
         lo_polygon/nil: Returns a list ofo_polygons which represent the
                         resultinggeometry after performing the operation
                         on thearguments. In case of an error, it returns nil.
         For example:
         (o_polygon_out1 o_polygon_out2  ...) is returned if theresult after
         performing the operation isa list of polys.
         (nil) is returned if theresult after performing the operation is a
         nil poly, that is considerperforming the AND operation on two
         non-overlapping set ofpolys.
         nil  is returned if the operationfails. A descriptive error message
         can be obtained by calling axlPolyErrorGet().
  EXAMPLES
         poly1_list = axlPolyFromDB(cline_dbid)
                 poly2_list = axlPolyFromDB(shape_dbid)
                 res_list = axlPolyOperation(poly1_list poly2_list 'OR)
