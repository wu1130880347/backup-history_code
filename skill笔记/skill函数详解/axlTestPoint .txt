设置或清除一个pin或via的测试点属性
NAME
         axlTestPoint - set or update pin/via testpoint
  FUNCTION
         axlTestPoint(
                 o_dbid
                 top|bottom|nil
         )
         ==> t/nil/s_error
  SYNOPSIS
         This sets or clears a pin/via's testpoint status.
         It abides by the rules of the testprep parameter form in its
         ability to add a testpoint (see possible errors below). If
         if can't add a testpoint due to testprep rules, an
         error symbol is returned. If the command fails for other
         reasons a nil is returned. On success a t is returned.
         If a test point is added to a pin/via already having a testpoint
         then the existing test point is replaced.
         Uses current testprep parameter settings except (these may be
         relaxed in future releases):
                 - set to flood
                 - set allow SMT/Blind or Thru pad stack type
         
         Not enabled in symbol editor.
         Adds test point text using same rules as the testpoint manual command.
         NOTE: does not delete associated test point text. This
                 may be a future enhancement. For present use
                 axlDeleteObject and axlDBGetAttachedText
         Supports axlDebug API to print failure to place error
  NEEDS
         o_dbid  - pin or via dbid.
         g_mode  - add to testpoint to top or bottom or clear one
  RETURNS
         t       - was able to change object
         nil     - error other then test point checks
         s_error - symbol indicating a error from testprep parameter check
             PAD_TOO_SMALL  - size doesn't meet parameter minimums
             PAD_UNDER_COMP - padstack under component
             PIN_OFF_GRID   - pin is off grid
             PAD_UNDEFINED  - layer of padstack not defined on required layer
             PAD_NOT_SMD    - padstack must be a smd
             PAD_NOT_THRU   - padstack must be a thru pad
             PIN_IS_VIA     - pin type requires a via or any point
             PIN_NOT_VIA    - pin type requires a via
             PIN_NOT_OUTPUT - pin type requires an output pin for testpoint
             PIN_NOT_IO     - pin type requires an IO pin for testpoint
             PIN_TOO_CLOSE  - pin to close to another testpoint
             PAD_UNDER_PIN  - testpoint under another pin
             PIN_NOT_NODE   - test method requires a node for testpoint
             PAD_IN_NO_PROBE_AREA - testpoint inside of NO_PROBE area   
             FIXED_TEST_POINTS - testpoints are fixed and can not be removed
             OTHER          - unclassified error
  EXAMPLE
         Example uses ashone.il file in <cdsroot>/share/pcb/skill/examples
         to allow user to select objects:
         1) add testpoint to top
                 axlUIWPrint(nil 'info1 "Select pin or via to add testpoint")
                 dbid = ashOne('(VIAS PINS))
                 ret = axlTestPoint(dbid 'top)
         2) clear a testpoint
                 axlUIWPrint(nil 'info1 "Select pin or via to clear testpoint")
                 dbid = ashOne('(VIAS PINS))
                 ret = axlTestPoint(dbid nil)
