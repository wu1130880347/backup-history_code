  SYNOPSIS
         Edits global settings of anexisting padstack.
         This edits the padstackdefinition, this means that anychanges made applies
         to all instances of thepadstacks (pins and vias) in the design.
         Supports the followingmodes:
          - If 1st 2arguments are nil returns a list of all editable attributes.
          - If padstack, attribute and newvalue are provided, changesone attribute of
            padstack.
          - If padstack, and a list ofattributes with new values are provided change
            all the items specifiedin the padastack. This is the most effecient
            method forchanging multiple items on a single padstack.
         TIPS:
            - Order is important, so if you arechanging a CIRCULAR drill to a slot then
              you must provide theholeType, then drillSizeWidththen drillSizeHeight.
            - For best performance ifchanging multiple items in a single padstack
              use the list mode tochange all items in one call.
         Currently only globalpadstack settings are supported. We currently
         do not allowediting pad layer characteristics.
         Certain changes will set DRC outof date and dynamic shapes out of date.
         Attributes currentlysupported (all Equiv items arefield names in pad_designer):
         Name:   drillDiameter
         Value:  dbrep
         Description: Changes thedrill diameter. Value must be a positive number and
                 holeType must not be aslot. For multi-drill applies to all drills.
         Side Effects: DRC is out ofdate and dynamic shapes are disabled.
         Equiv: Drill diameter field
         Name:   drillSizeWidth
         Value:  dbrep
         Description: Changes theslot size width (xdirection). Value must be a
                 positive number andholeType must be a slot type. Usually done
                 in association withdrillSizeHeight.
         Side Effects: DRC is out ofdate and dynamic shapes are disabled.
         Equiv: Slot size X
         Name:   drillSizeHeight
         Value:  dbrep
         Description: Changes theslot size width (ydirection). Value must be a
                 positive number andholeType must be a slot type. Usually done
                 in association withdrillSizeWidth.
         Side Effects: DRC is out ofdate and dynamic shapes are disabled.
         Equiv: Slot size Y
         Name:   holeType
         Value:  string
         Description: One of "CIRCLE_DRILL", "OVAL_SLOT" or "RECTANGLE_SLOT".
                 Changes hole type ofpadstack. If changing fundamental types:
                  - slot to drill;drillDiameter inherits drillSizeWidth.
                  - drill to slot;both drillSizeWidth and drillSizeHeight inherit
                    drillDiameter
                 For slotsdrillFigureName takes on figure for slot type selected
                 and itswidth and heght are the same as the slot width and height.
         Side Effects: DRC is out ofdate and dynamic shapes are disabled.
         Equiv: Hole type
         Name:   drillNonStandard
         Value:  string
         Description: Changes type of type ofnon-standard drill. Hole type must
                 be a circulardrill. Types are "LASER_DRILL", "PLASMA_DRILL",
