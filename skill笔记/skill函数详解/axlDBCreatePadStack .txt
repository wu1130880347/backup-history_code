             Pad (l_pad) structure (up to 3 for each layer)
                 layer         = (string) etch layer name (e.g. "TOP") or

                                 IfNULL we check the figureSize and
                                automatically assign a figure type. If you
                                assign a type thefigureSize must match
                                that type. For example, a SQUARE must have
                                 both width and height of the samevalue.
                                 Forshape symbol use the name of the
                                 ssm(minus extension and path) to figure
                                 Forexample if you have a shapesymbol
                                called "myshape" then it would be
                                 '?figure "myshape"'.
                                 Foran Anti-pad shape (fsm) assign the
                                symbol 'FLASH and assign the fsm file
                                 (minus extension and path to the flash
                                name. For example symbol "myflash" would
                                 be'?figure 'FLASH ?flash "myflash"'
                                 For either a shapeor flash, the symbol must
                                 belocated via PADPATH Also the ?figureSize
                                attribute must be the extents of the symbol
                                 or larger.
                 flash         = (string) the pad aperture flash name.
                                Reference a flash shape symbol name or nil
                                 for no flash (fsm file).
                 figureSize    = ( (f_width f_height) ) height and width of
                                 thefigure. For a circle you only need
                                 toassign diameter to either height/width,
                                 theother can be 0.
                 offset        = ( (f_x f_y) ) offset from the padstack origin
  NEEDS
         t_name:         Padstack name
         r_drill:        Drill hole data for the padstack.
                         Note: Aswith all Skill defstructs, use the
                         constructor function make_axlPadStackPad to create
                         instancesof axlPadStackPad.  See the examplesbelow.
         l_pad:          Pad definition data for the padstack.
                         Note: Aswith all Skill defstructs, use the
                         constructorfunction make_axlPadStackPad to create
                         instancesof axlPadStackPad. See the examples below.
         g_nocheck:      Optional. t disables checks ofthe padstack
                         definition.nil executes thefollowing checks of the
                         padstackdefinition:
                             -Contiguous pad definitions
                             -Anti-pad/thermal-relief pad definitions
                             -Existence of two pads with a drilled hole
                             - Adrilled hole with the existence of two pads
  RETURNS
         l_result/nil:   nil if nothing was created. Otherwise it returns a
                         dbid of the padstack created.
