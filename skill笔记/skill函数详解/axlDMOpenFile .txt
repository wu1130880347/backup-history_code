打开一个Allegro兼容的文件
  NAME
         axlDMOpenFile - opens an Allegrocompatible file
  FUNCTION
         axlDMOpenFile (
                 t_id
                 t_name
                 t_mode
         ) -> p_port/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Opens a file in conventionAllegro manner; adds an extension
         and optionally looks it up in a Allegrosearch path.
         Must have an entry infileops.txt file.
         Use this in place ofSkill's infile/outfile. The Skill
         interfaces resolve the filelocation using SKILLPATH which
         may mean that files may not open in the localdirectory if
         the SKILLPATH does not have "." as its firstcomponent.
         axlDMOpenFile uses the Allegroconvention to open file.
         Note if you use axlDMOpenFile to open a file, use axlDMClose
         to close it. All other Skill file APIs workon the port returned
         by this interface.
         If you want to useAllegro's standard file extension
         support (we will append the extension if not present) then
         see for list of t_ids
                <cdsroot>/share/pcb/text/fileops.txt
         Otherwise if you always providean extension use the "TEMP" id.
  HINT
         use get_filename(p_port) to obtain name offile
  NEEDS
         t_id:   id describing file attributes fromfileops.txt
                 Examples are "ALLEGRO_LAYOUT_DB" for Allegro
                         layoutswith extension brd, "ALLEGRO_REPORT"
                         for All egro reportfiles with extension rpt.
         t_name: name
         t_mode: open mode
            Option must be open ofthe following
              "r": open for reading
              "w": open for writing, create if doesn't exist truncate to
                         zero length if exists
              "a": open for writing, create if doesn't exist, go to end
                         of file for appending if exists
            In addition, the followingmodifiers are supported
              "f": Flush file aftereach write. This can be slow on Windows
                         if writing across thenetwork. This is typically
                         used if a process will takea long time and
                         the userwould like to look at the file to see
                         the progress. Example "wf"
              "b": Open in binarymode. This only has effect on Windows.
                         If file isAscii has the effect for reading
                         of not eliminating thecarriage-return (\r)
                         that are in DOS Ascii files. Forwriting doesn't
                         add thecarriage-return when it seesa linefeed
                         (writes it like aUNIX Ascii file).
                         Example "rb"
              "s": Allow spaces infile or directory name.Currently
                         Allegrodoesn't support this behavior. Setting
                         this optionis unsupported. Example "rbs"
  RETURNS
         p_port/nil:     A SKILL port if it can open file

  EXAMPLE
         - opens a file; clip.txt for writing
             aPort = axlDMOpenFile("ALLEGRO_TEXT" "clip" "w")
         - opens a file; b.bar
             aPort = axlDMOpenFile("TEMP" "foo.bar" "r")
