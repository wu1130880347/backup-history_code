  NAME
         axlColorDoc - Allegro colorinterface for Skill
  SYNOPSIS
         Allegro supports two coloraccess methods: pre-defined colors
         and allegro database colors. Not allAllegro based programs
         support access to allegrodatabase colors (this isonly
         supported by the graphicseditors.
         Pre-defined colors are set and accessed by theirsymbols.
         They are:
                 'black
                 'white
                 'red
                 'green
                 'yellow
                 'blue
                 'multivalue - usedfor fields where value not the same
                 'button - current color of buttonfaces (grey)
         In addition graphicseditors support access to the colors
         used for Allegro layers.These are integer numbers.
         AXL API calls such asaxlGetLayer("class/subclass") or
         its primitive form      
         axlGetParm("paramLayerGroup:<class>/paramLayer:<subclass>")
         return the current color setting of a layervia the color
         attribute call. Example:
                 p = axlGetLayer("etch/top")
                 p->color        -> 2
         These colors currently range between 1 and 24 with
         0 reserved for the backgroud color.
         Interfaces supportingsetting color are mostly form based.
         For there interfaces see:
                 axlFormDoc
                 axlFormColorize
                 axlFormGridDoc
                 axlGRPDoc
                 
  NOTES:
         - no AXL method iscurrently supported to allow you to change
                 the red/green/blue (RGB) of allegro databasecolors
         - We restrict thepre-defined colors to those defined to
                 minimize use ofcolors to minimize problems with
                 8 bit color graphicson UNIX. When 24 (or higher)
                 color cards becomestandard on UNIX this will be
                 relaxed.
