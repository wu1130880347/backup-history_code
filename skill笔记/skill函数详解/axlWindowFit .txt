  FUNCTION
         axlWindowFit(
         )
         ==> l_bBox
  SYNOPSIS
         Zooms in to (or out of) a design so that it fits fully on the
         window. For the Allegro layout editor, this performs a fit
         on the outline. See doc of axlLayoutExtent for more
         details. For the Allegro symbol editor, it performs a fit such that
         all visible objects occupy maximum window area.
         This is bound to the Allegro command "window fit".
         It returns the bounding box of the window after the fit has
         been performed.
  NEEDS
         nil
  RETURNS
         l_bBox          - The bounding box of the window after zooming
                           (in user units).
  NOTE
         This is available as the Allegro command "window fit".
