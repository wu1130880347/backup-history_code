  NAME
     axlIgnoreFixed - disable fixedproperty testing
  SYNOPSIS
     axlDBIgnoreFixed(
         [g_ignore]
     ) -> t/nil
  FUNCTION
     This provides similarfunctionality to that offered by many
     Allegro batch programs which allowsFIXED property to be
     ignored (e.g. netrev -z).
     If g_ignore is t FIXEDtesting is ignored, nilrestores
     FIXED testing. No argumentreports the current state
     of FIXED testing.
     This does NOT disable LOCKED orREAD-ONLY states. A parent
     can be locked which meansthe children cannot be modified
     (e.g. symbols locked to preventediting of its components).
     READ-ONLY objects are typicallyseen when you are in the
     partition editor.
  CAUTION
     It is important that FIXEDproperty testing be restored.
     Allegro automatically restoresFIXED testing if your
     Skill program returns toAllegro. This includes calling
     axlShell.
  NEEDS
     g_ignore - if t turnoff FIXED testing, nilrestore.
         no argument return currentstate of FIXED testing.
  RETURNS
     old fixed (nil FIXEDis enable, t isenabled)
