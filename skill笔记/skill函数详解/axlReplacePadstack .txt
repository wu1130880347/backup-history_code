  NAME
         axlReplacePadstack - replace anexisting pin/via padstack
  SYNOPSIS
         axlReplacePadstack(
                 o_dbid/lo_dbid
                o_padstackdbid/t_padname
         )
         ==> lo_dbid
  FUNCTION
         Replaces the padstack on aPin or Via (or on a list of them).
         The function will not print any errormessages unless you have
         argument errrors.
         The pin/via can be a list or asingle dbid. If the list contains
         items that are not a pin or viathey are silently ignored.
         Padstack can either bereferenced by name or a dbid. The padstack must be
         present in the Allegrodatabase. As an example, use axlDBCreatePadstack
         to obtain a dbid.
         Returns a list ofpins/vias that have had their padstacks changed.
         This may not be thesame as your initial list as the software
         removes dbid's that are not pins or vias and thoseitems where
         changing the padstack wouldcreate a database error (pin would
         be outside the boardextents).
         NOTE: Will not changesymbol defintion pins.
         CAUTION: Changing thepadstack on a pin in the drawing editor will
                 result in anexploded pin. This will increase your database
                 size and has impacts onrefresh_symbol.
         CAUTION: Using this function canresult in disconnects and new DRC
                 violations.
  PERFORMANCE HINTS:
         1) If you want tochange all instances of a particular padstack it
                 will be faster tochange the padstack itself.
         2) If you are changingmany pins and vias to the same padstack it
                 is faster to callthis function with a list of pin/vias instead
                 of calling it for eachone.
  NEEDS
         o_dbid/lo_dbid: List of AXLDBID's (pins or vias) or asingle DBID.
         o_dbid_padstack/t_padname:padstack may either be a name or dbid.
                         Padstackmust already be in the drawing.
  RETURNS
         lo_dbid - returns list ofvias/pins that had padstack changed. This
                 is always a list.
         nil     - Error or nothing in the list was apin or a via.
  EXAMPLES:
         1) Change a single viato "VIA" padstack
                 via = <dbid of avia>
                 via = axlReplacePadstack( via, "VIA")
         2) Change all vias onboard to "VIA" padstack
                 ;; ashFindAllPins --example Skill code to find all vias on brd
                 vias =ashFindAllPins( )
                 via = axlReplacePadstack( via, "VIA")
         3) Change a single viato pad dbid
                 via = <dbid of avia>
                 pad = <dbid of apad>
                 via = axlReplacePadstack( via, pad )
