NAME
         axlCnsClassTableCreate - create or modify a classtable entry
  SYNOPSIS
         axlCnsClassTableCreate(
                 g_class1
                 g_class2
                 g_region
                s_csetType/ll_typeAndName
                 [t_csetName]
         ) -> o_dbidClassTable/nil
  FUNCTION
         This creates a class tableentry that consists of any of the following:
            - class to class     (spacing only)
            - region to class    (spacing, same net and phsyical)
            - region to class toclass (spacing only)
         Optionally, it associates aspacing, phsyical and/orsame net cset with
         that table entry.  If a class table entry already exists it is modified
         with the provided csets.
         Regions are not available in PCB L and lower products, command will
         fail if you attempt tocreate a region based table entry in these products.
         Class tables may not be created insymbol editor.
  NOTES:
         - The order of class1 and class2 does not matter.
         - If an entry already exists it will return the existing entry.
         - Netclasses can beclassified by domain (spacing and/or physical). If a
           netclass is restricted toone domain, it is possible tocreate a
           netclass to "whatever" entry that crossesdomains. This table entry will
           be ignored by DRC. Forexample, you have a netclassin both domains called
           "ANY" and another restrictedto the physical domain called "PHYS". It is
           possible to create a "ANY to "PHYS"relationship which is onlyappropriate in
           the spacing domain butthe PHYS netclass is not legal in that domain.
           We may test and reject for this condition infuture releases.
         - DRC is set out-of-date, you must manuallyupdate the DRC.
         - Unlike constraint manager, you can add csetnames that don't yet exist in
           the database. In thesecases, we willautomatically create a cset. Check
           via axlCnsList if your cset exists if you don't wish tocreate new csets.
         - Class table entries mayalso have constraint overrides attached via
           property overrides (axlDBAddProp)
         DRC is set out of date.
  NEEDS
         g_class1 = NETCLASS dbid or name of name class
         g_class2 = NETCLASS dbid, name of name class or nil
         g_region = REGION dbid, name of region or nil
         s_csetType - symbol cset type one of 'spacing, 'physical or 'samenet
         t_csetName - string csetname for given type
         ll_typeAndName - option list of values where you have
                         ((s_csetTypet_csetName) (s_csetTypet_csetName) ...)
  RETURNS
         returns dbid of type classTable for new or existing cset or nil if error

  EXAMPLES
         -) create appropriate entries in design
                 region = axlRegionCreate("ANALOG")
                 ncls = axlNetClassCreate("VOLTAGE" '(spacing physical))
         1) add new spacing region-class tableentry and give it the spacingcset "25MILS"
                 tbl = axlCnsClassTableCreate("VOLTAGE" nil "ANALOG" 'spacing "25MILS")
         2) alternative method plus also add a physicalvoltage cset
                 props = '((spacing "25MILS") (physical "VOLTAGE"))
                 tbl = axlCnsClassTableCreate(ncls nil region props)
