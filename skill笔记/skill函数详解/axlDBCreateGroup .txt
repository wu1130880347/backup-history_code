  NAME
         axlDBCreateGroup - Create a group ofdatabase objects.
  SYNOPSIS
         axlDBCreateGroup(
             t_name
             t_type
             lo_groupMembers
         ) ==> o_dbid/nil
  FUNCTION
         Creates a new groupdatabase object which hasmembers which are
         specified bylo_groupMembers.
  NEEDS
         t_name                  A string providing the nameof the group. If
                                 thename is already used by an existing group,
                                this procedure will fail (and return nil).
         t_type                  A string which defines the type of group. The
                                legal values are:
                                    "generic"
                                    "net_group"
         lo_groupMembers         A list of axl dbid's. This defines themembers
                                 ofthe group.  Duplicate dbid entries willbe
                                silently ignored (i.e. an object will only be
                                 added to a group once). A single dbid canbe
                                substituted for a list.
                                There are certain restrictions on the members
                                 ofa group. If they are violated, this
                                 procedure fails (and return nil).
                                    -   For each group type has only certainobjects
                                        that are allowed. For example generic groups
                                        only permit: group, component, symbol, net, path,
                                        via, shape, polygon, pin, text.
                                    -   A circular group relationshipcan not
                                        be formed. For example, group A can
                                        not be added as a member of group B if
                                        group B is directly or indirectly a
                                         member of group A.
  RETURNS
         o_dbid          The dbid of the newly formed group.
         nil             If the group could not be created.

  EXAMPLE
         1) Generic group
             groupMembers = axlGetSelSet()
             group_dbid = axlDBCreateGroup("my_group" "generic" groupMembers)
         2) Net group
             groupMembers = axlSelectByName("NET" "NET*" t)
             group_dbid = axlDBCreateGroup("NG1" "net_group" groupMembers)
  NOTE
         The order of the groupmembers which is provided when you access the
         groupMembers property ofthe group may vary from the order which was
