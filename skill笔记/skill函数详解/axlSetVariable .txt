设置环境变量
  NAME
        axlSetVariable - sets Allegroenvironment variables
  FUNCTION
         axlSetVariable(
                 t_variable
                 g_value
                 )
         ==> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Sets the Allegroenvironment variable with the name given by the string
         t_variable to the valueg_value. g_value can be a string, int, t, or
         nil. Returns the string assigned to thevariable or nil if the variable
         cannot be set inAllegro.
         Note: 511 is themaximum list long (lt_variable).
  NOTES
         1) Variablenames/values can change from release to release.
         2) Variable settings only apply tocurrent session. They are not
                 saved to user'slocal env file.
         3) Variable changes do not effectprograms launched from Allegro
                 e.g. import logic, refresh_symbol
         4) Many Allegrooperations are done via batch operations such
            as items in FileImport/Export, artwork, axlRunBatchDBProgram, etc.
            These operations do NOT seevariables changed (likePSMPATH) by
            this call or by theAllegro set command.
  NEEDS
         t_variable:     name of the Allegro environment variable.
         g_value:        Value to which the environmentvariable is to be set.
                         Can be astring, int, t, or nil.
  RETURNS
         t/nil:          Returns t ifsuccessful. Returns nil if invalid data
                         type ofvariable is marked read-only.

  EXAMPLES
         The following example setsthe new library search path "libpath".
            axlSetVariable("libpath" "/mytools/library")
                 ==> t
            libraryPath = axlGetVariable("libpath")
                 ==> "/mytools/library"
         Using list mode:
            axlSetVariable("psmpath" '("." "symbols"))
                 ==> t
            axlGetVariableList("psmpath")
                 ==> ("." "symbols")
