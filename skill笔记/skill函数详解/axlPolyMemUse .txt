获得某个多边形的内存使用情况
  NAME
         axlPolyMemUse - debug functiontracking polygon memory usage.
  FUNCTION
         axlPolyMemUse (
         ) -> lx_polyCounts
  SYNOPSIS
         This returns a list ofintegers reflecting the internal memory
         use of the axlPolyinterfaces. If you assign Poly objects to
         global handles (instead of assigningto locals, e.g let or prog
         statements) then youneed to insure all of global data is nil-ed
         at the end of your program.The example below shows how to check
         that you have written yourprogram correctly.
         Description of 5integers. Integers 2 through 5 are for Cadence use.
            1 - Most important and showsnumber of Skill Polys still in use.
            2 - Number of AllegroPolys in use. This is always >= to Skill
                Polys. Theadditional polys are voids (holes) in the Skill
                polys
            3 - Number of edgesin all Allegro polys.
            4 - Number of AllegroFloating Point Polys; should be 0.
            5 - Number of edgesin all Allegro Floating Point Polys; should be 0.
  NEEDS
         nothing
  RETURNS
         lx_polyCounts: a list of 5integers reflecting Poly memory usage

  EXAMPLES
         1) Verify at end ofyour program you have no hanging Poly memory
                 in use.
