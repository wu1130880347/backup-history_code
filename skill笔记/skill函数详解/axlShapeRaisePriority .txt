提到动态shape 空洞的优先级
  NAME
         axlShapeRaisePriority - raise voidingpriority of dynamic shape
  FUNCTION
         axlShapeRaisePriority(
                 o_shapeId
         ) -> x_priority/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This will raise the voidingpriority of dynamic shape (o_shapeId) to
         the highest on that layer.This means that if this shape overlaps
         other dynamic shapes on alayer then the other shapes will be voided
         away from this shape.
         The priority number isrelative. Allegro will adjust the numbers
         as needed. You should onlyuse the priority number for comparison
         with other dynamic shapepriority numbers.
         For a dynamic shape (those onCLASS=BOUNDARY) the attribute
         "priority" will reflectcurrent priority (e.g.dbid->priority).
  TIP
         If raising priority onmultiple shapes or doing multiple operations
         on a single shape (e.g. convert then raisepriority) consider wrapping
         the code in axlDBCloak to batch updates.
  NEEDS
         o_shapeId - dynamic shapeid.
  RETURNS
         x_priority > 0: then newpriority of shape
                     -1:already at highest priority
                     nil: not adynamc shape
