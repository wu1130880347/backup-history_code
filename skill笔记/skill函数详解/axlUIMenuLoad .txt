  NAME
         axlUIMenuLoad - Load the main window's menu from a file
  SYNOPSIS
         axlUIMenuLoad (
             t_menuFile
         ) ==> t_previousMenuName/nil
  FUNCTION
         Loads the main window's menu from the file t_menuFile. The default menu
         filename extension is added if t_menuFile has none. The MENUPATH
         environment variable is used to locate the file if t_menuFile is
         not a rooted file name.
  NEEDS
         t_menuFile      The name of the file to which the menu is to be dumped.
                         If t_menuFile is nil, the file name will be based on
                         the program's default menu name (which may vary based
                         on the current state of the program).
  RETURNS
         The name of the previous menu or nil if the menu could not
         be loaded.
  NOTE
         The intent of this procedure is to allow a custom menu to
         be loaded for debugging purposes.
