  NAME
         axlShapeAutoVoid - autovoid a staticshape
  FUNCTION
         axlShapeAutoVoid(
            o_shapeId
            [s_options/ls_options]
         )
         ==> lo_shapeIds/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This autovoids a staticshape.
         Shape must be voidable and static (voiding dynamicshapes or
         dynamic generated shapes isnot supported).
         Uses current static shapeparameters to control voiding except where
         options provide anoverride.
         A file, shape.log isproduced as a side effect of the autovoid.
         Neither the existence ofthis file nor its contents is guaranteed
         in future releases.
         OPTIONS:
              'noRipThermals - bydefault autovoid will rip-up all existing
                 thermal ties inshape and then recreate a new set. This
                 maintains existingthermals.
              'fragment - by default, if shapewill fragment into multiple
                         shapes willask the user before proceeding this
                         will allowsilent fragment. Overrides setting in
                         staticshape parameter record.
              'noFragment - oppositeof fragment. API will fail if shape
                         needs to befragmented.
  CAUTIONS
         1) This should not be usedto void shapes on negative planes.
            Inside voiding will not berepresented in artwork.
  NEEDS
         o_shapeId - a voidableshape
         s_options - single optionsymbol (see above)
         ls_options - list ofoptions (see above)
  RETURNS
         lo_shapeId - list ofvoided shape. Normally this is one shape
                 unless shapeis broken into multiple pieces
         nil - failed to void or illegalarguments
