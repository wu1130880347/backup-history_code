         To snap the point (3162.0 1315.0) to grid:
                 snappedPoint = axlEnterPoint(?gridSnap t ?points
                                        '((3162.0 1315.0)))
         If you had a non-snappedpoint and wanted to get the snapped point:
                 snappedPoint = axlEnterPoint(?gridSnap t
                                 ?points list(3162.3 1315.8))
