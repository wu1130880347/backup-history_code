         axlDBCreateVia(

  SYNOPSIS
        Creates a via in the layoutas specified by the arguments described
         below.
  NEEDS
         t_padstack              - The padstack name for the via.  If a
                                 padstack definition with this name is not
                                already in the layout, the function
                                searches in order the libraries specified
                                 byPADPATH and loads the definitioninto
                                 thedatabase.
         o_padstackDbid          - a padstack dbid
         l_anchorPoint           - The location of the via
         t_netName               - The net name. (nil is standalone)
         g_mirror                - t --> via is mirrored, nil --> not.
                                        - 'GEOMETRY --> only geometry is mirrored.
         f_rotation              - The rotation angle.
         o_parent                - axl DBID of object to add thevia to
                                        (symbol instance or nil for design)
  RETURNS
         l_result/nil:          - nil if not created, or a list containing
                                        (car) axl DBID of the via
                                         (cadr) t if DRCs created or nil.
  NOTE
         axlDBCreateVia cannot create atest point. It will have to be set
                 via axlTestPoint function.
  EXAMPLE
         The following example addsa standalone via using padstack "pad1"
         at x 5600 y4200 on net "sclkl," mirrored and rotated.
         myvia = axlDBCreateVia( "pad1", 5600:4200, "sclkl", t, 45.0, nil)
                 ==> (dbid:526745 nil)
         This adds a via rotated at 45 degrees:
