  NAME
         axlFormRestoreField  - sets field back to last value
  FUNCTION
         axlFormRestoreField(
                 r_form
                 t_field
                 )
         ==> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Restores t_field in openform r_form to its previous value. The previous value is only
         from the last user change and not from form set field functions, so this function is
         only useful in the formcallback function.
         Use this function in the formcallback to restore the previous value when you detect the
         user has entered an illegalvalue in the field.
  NEEDS
         r_form:         Form dbid.
         t_field:        Name of the field.
  RETURNS
         t/nil:          Returns t if the field was restored. Returns nil if the field was not
                         restored (for example, if the field does not exist).
  EXAMPLES
         See axlFormCreate examples where the callback function checks that theuser has
         entered in field "view_file" a filename that ison the list of availableextract view
         filenames. If theuser-entered value is not, then the program calls axlFormRestoreField
         to restore the field to itsprevious value.
                 (case form->curField
                  ("view_file"
                  (if form->curValue
                  (progn
                  ; Accept user inputonly if on list
                  if(member( form->curValuefileList)
                 then axlFormSetField( form
                         "view_file" form->curValue)
                  else axlFormRestoreField(
                 form "view_file"))))
