在现有的一个窗口上显示一个指定的帮助标记
  NAME
     axlUIWSetHelpTag - subclasses help tag on an existing window
  SYNOPSIS
     axlUIWSetHelpTag(
         r_window
         t_tag
         )
         -> t/nil
  FUNCTION
      This has been mostly replaced by axlUIWHelpRegister which will work
      for either commands or forms.
      Attaches the given help tag to a pre-existing dialog
      (anything with a Port). This function employs subclassing
      of the help tags. This means that if a help tag is already
      associated with the dialog, this new help tag will be added
      to it - it will *not* replace it. Adding a new help tag to
      a pre-existing one is done by concatenating the two with a dot.
      For example:
  
      Pre-existing Help Tag: foo
      New Help Tag:          bar
  
      Resulting Help Tag:    foo.bar
  
  NEEDS
         r_window:       Window id.
         t_tag:          subclass help string
  RETURNS
         t for success, nil for failure (invalid arguments)
