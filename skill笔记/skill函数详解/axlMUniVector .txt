返回两个点之间的单位矢量
  NAME
         axlMUniVector - return a unit vector betweentwo points
  FUNCTION
         axlMUniVector(
                 l_pt1
                 l_pt2
                 [f_length]
         ) -> l_uniPt1
  SYNOPSIS
         This calculates aunit-vector. A unit vector allows one to
         calculate points additional points alongthat line.
         Has two modes of operation:
         1) Without a length return a unit vector to beused in other
            operations likeaxlMXYMult. Use this mode if you need
            to calculate severalpoints from the same unit vector.
         2) With a lengthcalculates a new xy location f_length from
            l_pt1 along the vectorspecified by pt1 and pt2.
         This provides optimizedsolution over the traditional
         trigometric approach.
  NEEDS
         l_pt1, l_pt2: 2 xypoints
         f_length: optional length toproject
  RETURNS
         returns a unit-vector, xy point
         nil: arguments were not xypoints

  EXAMPLES
         1) Found a point 5 unitsalong a line from 1263.0:1062.0
            to 1338.0:1137.0
                 origin = 1263.0:1062.0
                 uniVec = axlMUniVector(origin 1338.0:1137.0)
                 res = axlMXYMult(uniVec, 5.0 origin)
         2) Same as example 1 excepthave uni vec do all the work
                 res = axlMUniVector(origin 1338.0:1137.0 5.0)
