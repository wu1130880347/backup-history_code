在某层之上增加一个新的层
  NAME
     axlLayerCreateCrossSection - create a newcross-section layer for conductor classes.
  FUNCTION
     axlLayerCreateCrossSection(
         t_Prev_layerName
         t_layerType
         t_materialType
         [t_subclassName]
         [t_planeType]
     )
     ==> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Adds a new cross-sectionlayer to the design.
         t_subclassName is nil then anunnamed dielectric layer is created. It
         is suggested that youcreate unnamed dielectric layers if they are only
         required for signalanalysis and board thickness calculations since using
         a name will ETCH layer inthe design.
  NEEDS
         t_Prev_layerName   -- Layer name above which the new layer is to
                               be added.
         t_layerType        -- The type of layer to beadded, such as
                               "CONDUCTOR" or "SURFACE". See cross section
                              dialog for a complete list of layer types.
         t_materialType     -- The material of the layer See crosssection
                              dialog for a complete list of available
                              materials.
         t_subclassName     -- Optional. Name of the new layer
         t_planeType        -- Optional. Type of plane, either "POSITIVE"
                               or "NEGATIVE". The default isPositive.
  RETURNS
         t/nil   - nil if not created,
                 - t if createdor, if it alaready exists

  EXAMPLE
         The following examplecreates a conductor layer that:
             * Is located above alayer subclass called Bottom
             * Has copper as thelayer material
             * Has a subclass namecalled New_Layer
             * Is a positive plane
         axlLayerCreateCrossSection("BOTTOM" "Conductor"
                         "Copper" "NEW_LAYER" "Positive")
