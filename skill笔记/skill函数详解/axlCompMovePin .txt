  NAME
     axlCompMovePin
  FUNCTION
     This function moves the specifiedpin(s) by the specified
     delta x/y, rotation, and mirror. Rotation and mirror, if provided,
     are applied around therotatePoint (defaults to 0,0 if not provided).
     A rotation to apply to each individualpin may also be provided.
  SYNOPSIS
     axlCompMovePin(o_pin/lo_pins
                    ?move            l_deltaPoint
                    ?groupMirror     t/nil
                    ?groupRotation   f_angle
                    ?rotOrigin       l_rotatePoint
                    ?pinRotation     f_deltaAngle
     ) => t/nil
  NEEDS
     o_pin/lo_pins  -- skill dbid of the pin to be moved, or a list
                       of pins to bemoved.
     move           -- X/Y delta to move each pin in theset by.
     groupMirror    -- t if the position of each pin in thegroup should
                       be mirroredaround the supplied rotOrigin.
     groupRotation -- angle of rotation that should be applied to
                       each pin inthe group to determine its new
                       finallocation. Applied around rotOrigin.
     rotOrigin      -- X/Y origin for group mirror and rotationapplication.
     pinRotation    -- Rotation to apply to individual pins once placed
                       at newlocation.
             e.g. When moving a pinfrom the north side to west side,
             and the pin isrectangular, you may wish tospecify a
             rotation of 90 degrees to keep thesame orientation of the
             pin rectangle relativeto the nearest die edge.
  RETURNS
     t if the pin(s) were moved.
     nil if there was an error moving any of thepins, e.g. if a pin
         had the fixed property or would be placedoutside the extents.
   NOTES
     If many pins are to be moved, it is moreefficient to pass the entire
     list to this function to process them in one call than tocall
     axlCompMovePin with eachindividual pin.
     Also of note: When applyingmultiple transforms at once to the set of pins,
     the operations are performed inthe following order:
         #1. group mirror isperformed for the group about thespecified rotOrigin.
         #2. group rotation is then applied, also around therotOrigin.
         #3. move delta is then applied.
     This is important to keep inmind so that you achieve the desired end position
     for all pins being moved, and so that you use thecorrect rotOrigin point.
