  NAME
         axlDBCreateShape - create a shape inthe database
  FUNCTION
         axlDBCreateShape(
             o_polygon / r_path
             [l_r_fill/t/nil]
             [t_layer]
             [t_netName]
             [o_parent]
         )
         ==> l_result/nil
  
  SYNOPSIS
         This is a convenience function that takes the samearguments as
         axlDBCreateOpenShape and adds the o_polygon or r_path shape to the
         database in exactly thesame way. The only difference is that this
         function creates the shape and puts it into theclosed state
         immediately, rather than leavingit open for later modification.
         Use axlDBCreateShape to add shapeswithout voids.
         axlDBCreateShape has the samerestrictions on its arguments as
         axlDBCreateOpenShape.
  
  NEEDS
         o_polygon/r_path:  The outline as an r_path from axlPathXXX data
                         structure or an o_polygon fromaxlPolyXXX interfaces.
         l_r_fill:       Can have one of three possible values:
                         t --> create shapesolid filled
                         nil --> create shapeunfilled
                         or a list of structuresspecifying crosshatch
                         parameters for creating the shape:
                         Note: Aswith all SKILL defstructs, use
                         constructorfunction:
                            make_axlFill to create instancesof axlFill.
                         Use copy function
                            copy_axlFill to copy instances ofaxlFill.
         t_layer:        Layer on which the shape is to be created.
         t_netName:      Name of the net of which the shape is to bea member.
         o_parent:       dbid of the object to be the parent ofthe shape
                         (the parent can be asymbol instance or nil for the
                         designitself).
  RETURNS
         l_result/nil:   nil if nothing was created. Otherwise it returns a
                         list:
                         * (car) dbid of shapecreated
                         * (cadr)t if DRCs created.Otherwise returns nil.

  EXAMPLE
         p1 = axlPolyFromDB(inElem)
         ;; add it as a unfilled shape onBOARD GEOMETRY/OUTLINE
         res = axlDBCreateShape( car(p1) nil "BOARDGEOMETRY/OUTLINE")
