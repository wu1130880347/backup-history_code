  NAME
         axlMenuDoc - Allegro men fileformat
  SYNOPSIS
MENUS:
Allegro tools typically supportthree menus; drawing, symbol and
partition. The Allegro command set is verydifferent between these
three design editors. Also menusets exist differnt tools such as
APD, SIP and the SI (Signal Integrity) products (see below).
All of the tiering (product levels) within a productare managed
via the "#ifdef" statements within asingle menu file. Typically
the settings of environmentvariables controlling the tiering
are documented at the top of file.Note you cannot strip out
the #ifdef statements to gainaccess to missing commands.
FINDING MENUS:
Allegro finds the menus with itsMENUPATH environment variable. The
default Allegro menus are locatedin:
        <cdsroot>/share/pcb/text/cuimenus
The menus in this directory are asfollows (due to the tools andsoftware
version you have loaded some may not bepresent in your installation).
You should not modify any otherfile type in this directory as only
the menu files are supported for usermodification.
         allegro.men     - Menu for PCB designs
         pcb_symbol.men  - Symbol menu for PCB products
         partition.men   - Parition menu for PCB products
         specctraquest.men - PCB SImenu

         sip.men         - SIP menu
         icp_symbol.men  - APD/SIP symbol editor menu
         apd_partition.men - APD Paritioneditor menu
         sip_partition.men - SIPParition editor menu
         apd_si.men      - APD SI menu
         padlayout.men   - Pad Designer (in brd graphics editor)
         padlaystn.men   - Pad Designer (standalone)

CAUTION:
         As new products are addedin a release; new menu files may
         be added. Also Cadence maychange the name of any menu
         file in a release.
MENU Terms
         Menubar - the menu itemsseen at the top of a Window
         Menu item - a menu line;may either be a command, separator
                 or asubmenu.
         Separator - a horizontalline drawn to visually group menu items.
         Submenu - a pulldown (from menbar) or apull-right (from
                 another submenu). Submenus may onlyhave a display
                 and commandassociation is not supported.
MENU DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
         - Certain dynamic items mayexist. These are currently
           the MRU (most recently usedfiles) and Quickreports.
           Do not attemptto modify these items.
         - Do not usespaces in the display for the menubar.
         - All menubar items shouldbe submenus. Do not add a
           command menu item at thislevel.
         - Do not addexcessive items to the menubar. If the menubar
           displays on two lines for atypical window width you may
           have too many items.
         - Keep the display textrelatively short,especially on the menubar.
MENU CUSTOMIZATION METHODS
         - Provide own customizationmenu via CDS_SITE. Replace
           the Cadence provided menu(.men file) with your own.  
              - Advantages:Relatively easy and no Skill programming required.
              - Disadvanges: For newreleases need to merge your menu
                 changes with newCadence menus. May need to modify
                 multiple menus
         - Overload your menucustomizations on Cadence menus via
           Skill axlUIMenuRegister.
              - Advantages:Relatively easy with minimal Skill programming.
                         Dependingon your site's additions may is immune
                         to manyCadence menu changes.
              - Disadvanges: Cannot deleteCadence menu items or restrict
                         yourchanges to a one Cadence menu.
         - Register a axl menuTrigger notification via axlTriggerSet
              - Advantages: Almostas much flexibity as overriding
                         the defaultmenu file including targeting
                         specificmenus.
              - Disadvanges: Need toexamine your Skill code with
                         with newCadence releases. Requires much
                         more Skillprogramming knowledge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
DYNAMICALLY LOADING MENUS:
         All tools supportoverriding their default menus by putting your
         file before the defaultCadence menu file via the MENUPATH.
         Programs that supportaxl-Skill allow menus to be dynamically
         changed while theprogram is running. This can be done
         using the axlUIMenuLoad Skill function.  This is notsupported in
         allegro_pcb andallegro_viewer.
         See axlUIMenuLoad documentation
         Tools support dynamically (via Skill) modifing menus
         (see axlUIMenuFind).

MENU FILE FORMAT:
Only one menu definition ispermitted per file. The following is in
the file syntax in BNF format.Normally indents are used to reflect
the menu hierarchy in the men file.
  []      Optional
  {}      May repeat one or more times
  <>      supplied by user
  |       Choose one or the other
  :       Definition of a token
  CAPS    Items in caps are keywords
  (#)    Note, see number at endof this documentation
FILE:
         [comment]
         [ifdef]
         <name> MENUDISCARDABLE
         BEGIN
            {popup}
         END
popup:
         POPUP "<display>"
         BEGIN
             {MENUITEM "<display>"               "<command>"}
             [{separator}]
             {[popup]}
         END
{[//]}          - comment lines
separator:
         MENUITEM SEPARATOR
                 - this inserts aseparator (a line) at this spot in
                 the menu. This is not supportat the top level (menubar)
name:       This text is currrently ignored. Youshould use the file
                 name minus theextension.
comment:    double slash (//) can be used anyway to start acomment
display:    Text shown to the user
                 & - This isused to enable keyboard access to the
                         menus. Forthis to work each menu level must
                         have aunique key assigned to it. Use double
                         ampersnd (&&) to get display a "&"
                 ... - Three dots isa convention that this command
                         displays aform
command:    This is any Allegro command, sequence of Allegrocommands
                 or Skillstatement. The Allegro command parser acts
                 on this statementso it offers considerable flexibilty.
                 The command shouldbe placed within a set of double
                 quotes ("). Doublequotes are not supported within this
                 command string.
ifdef:      Use #ifdef/#endif and #ifndef/#endif (sorry,no #else) to make
             items conditionallyappear in the menu depending on whether or not
             a specified environmentvariable is set.
             A #ifdef will cause themenu item(s) to be ignored unless the
             environment variable isset.  You must have one #endif for
             each #ifdef or #ifndefto end the block of conditional menu
             items. Also, the#ifdef, #ifndef and #endif must start at
             the first column of itsline in the menufile. The #ifndef is
             the negation of #ifdef.
             The condition syntaxsupports multiple variables with OR '||' or
             AND '&&'conditions. Also the negation character '!' is supported
             for the variables:
             These statements may be nested.
             The simple syntax is:
                 #ifdef <envvariable name>
                 [menu items whichappear if the env variable is set]
                 #endif
                 #ifndef <envvariable name>
                 [menu items whichappear if the env variable is NOT set]
                 #endif
                 # logicallyequivalent to above state using negation character
                 #ifdef !<envvariable name>
                 [menu items whichappear if the env variable is NOT set]
                 #endif
             Also logical statements
              1) if variable1 andvariable2 are both set do the included statement
                 #ifdef <var1>&& <var2>
                 [menu items whichappear if both variables are set]
                 #endif
              2) if either variable1or variable2 is do the included statement
                 #ifdef <var1>|| <var2>
                 [menu items whichappear if either variable is set]
                 #endif
            
             The items between the#if[n]def/#endif can be one or more
             MENUITEMs or could be aPOPUP.
             In the followingexample, the items the "Export" popup appears in
             the menu only if the "menu_enable_export" envvariable is set:
                 #ifdefmenu_enable_export
                     POPUP "&Export"
                     BEGIN
                     MENUITEM "&Logic...",   "feedback"
                     END
                 #endif
             In the followingexample, the "ProductNotes" menuitem appears in
             the menu only if the "menu_disable_product_notes" envvariable is
             NOT set:
                 #ifndefmenu_disable_product_notes
                     MENUITEM "&ProductNotes",    "help -file algpn"
                 #endif
