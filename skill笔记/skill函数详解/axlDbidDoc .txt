用skill文件描述Allegro数据
  NAME
         axlDbidDoc - Allegro databaserepresentation in Skill
  SYNOPSIS
         Only objects added/modifiedare currently documented
         here. See AXL SkillReference manual for others.
  TIP
         Use axlDebug to enable error messages for invalid attributs
         of Allegro dbids. Allowsdetection of typos when fetching data
         from dbids. This entails aslight performance hit.
         For example, it you have a pindbid and you do a
                 pin->bbox (instead ofpin->bBox)
         then an error will be issued.

  NOTE: If a shape is aauto-generated shape (shapeBoundary != nil) then
         it cannot be maniplated (e.g. moved, property add, delete etc.).
         You should modify thedynamic shape (shapeBoundary). See

         the boundary shape if one of itsauto-generated children is
         selected by the user.
