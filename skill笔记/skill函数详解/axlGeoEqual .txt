根据当前精度测试两个浮点数是否相等
  NAME
         axlGeoEqual - are two floatingpoint numbers equal within epsilon
  FUNCTION
         axlGeoEqual(
                 f_one
                 f_two
         ) -> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This performs an equalcomparision between two floating point
         numbers anddetermine if they are equal within plus or minus
         the current databaseaccuracy.
                 
         This is useful if you arecomparing floating point numbers
         converted from strings (example using atof function) with
         those obtained from an AXLdatabase id. Since the conversion
         of these numbers takedifferent paths (stringto float versus
         interger to float in the case of thedatabase) you can
         have different numbers.
         To understand the basis ofwhy you can't always do a simple
         equal comparison withfloating point numbers see
         Rather than try to explainit why you cannot always use a simple
         '==' comparison between twofloating point numbers, I'll just link
         to David Goldberg'sexcellent paper on the subject, "What Every Computer
         Scientist Should Know AboutFloating-Point Arithmetic."  It's very
         rigorous, and will require somepatient study, but if youwork through
         the theorems you'll neverbe bitten by this again.
