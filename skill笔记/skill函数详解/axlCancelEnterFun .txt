  EXAMPLES
         Enter Function Example
         You use the AXL-SKILL axlCancelEnterFun and axlFinishEnterFun functions
         when you create an interactive commandthat loops on user input, so the
         user can terminate thecommand.
         The following example doesthe following:
             1. Defines thefunctions axlMyCancel and axlMyDone.
             2. Defines a pop-upwith those functions as the callbacks for user
                selections Cancel and Done from thepop-up.
             3. Loops on the function axlEnterPath gathering userinput to create
                 a multi-segment line on "etch/top."
         The user terminates thecommand at any time by selecting Cancel or Done
         from the pop-up.
         (defun axlMyCancel ()
                 axlClearDynamics()
                 axlCancelEnterFun()
                 axlUIPopupSet(nil))
         (defun axlMyDone ()
                 axlClearDynamics()
                 axlFinishEnterFun()
                 axlUIPopupSet(nil))
         mypopup = axlUIPopupDefine( nil
                 (list (list "MyCancel" 'axlMyCancel)
                 (list "MyDone" 'axlMyDone)))
         axlUIPopupSet( mypopup)
         ; Clear the dynamic buffer
         axlClearDynamics()
         ; Clear mypath to nil, then loopgathering user picks:
         mypath = nil
         while( (mypath = axlEnterPath(?lastPath mypath))
                 progn( axlDBCreatePath(mypath, "etch/top")))
         The program gathers onepick from the user and extends the database path by
         that pick during each timearound the while loop. The userterminates the
         loop by picking Done fromthe pop-up. The user can cancel out at any time
         by selecting Cancel. Thesegments added become permanent in the database
         when the loop terminates.
