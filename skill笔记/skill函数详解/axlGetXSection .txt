  NAME
     axlGetXSection - return crosssection of design
  SYNOPSIS
     axlGetXSection(
     )
     ==> l_layers/nil
  FUNCTION
     This function returns a list of allthe layers in the cross section
     found in the current drawing.
  NOTES
     The t_SignalDieConstant andt_SignalLossTangent values are the values
     for dielectric materialbetween traces on signal layers. Beginning with
     15.0, the dieConst/LossTanfor dielectric material on signal layers is
     stored in a Property.
     The dielectric materialproperties from the dielectric layer above
     (Towards the closest surface) will be used as thedielectric material
     between signal traces unless theDESIGN property "SQ_STRIPLINE_DIELECTRIC"
     is set.  Then this defines the Material, Dielectric Constantand LossTangent
     to be used fornon-plane, non-surfaceconductor layers. Surface layers always
     look to the outside for theirdielectric.
     If the Property is missing, invalid or thematerial in the property is set to
     "_LS_AUTOMATIC_", then thet_SignalDieConstant and t_SignalLossTangent values
     will be set tomatch those of the adjacent dielectric (looking towards the
     closest surface).
  CAUTION
     New releases may add to the list of datareturned for each layer.
     These items will be added atthe end of the list.
     Added items:
          16.01 - g_freqDepFileName
  RETURNS
     An ordered skill list oflayers in the board's cross section.
     Each layer will be defined by alist of the following format:
       (t_name t_type t_material t_thicknesst_thermalCond t_elecCond
        t_dielectricConsty_artworkNeg y_shield t_lossTangent
        t_usage t_SignalDieConstantt_SignalLossTangent g_freqDepFileName
        t_etchFactor)
     where:
        t_name is layer name
        t_type is layer type
        t_material is layer material
        t_thickness is layerthickness
        t_thermalCond is layerthermal conductivity
        t_elecCond is layerelectrical conductivity
        t_dielectricConst is thelayer dielectric constant
        y_artworkNeg indicateswhether or not the artwork for the layer isnegative
        y_shield indicates wether or not thelayer is a shield layer
        t_lossTangent is the layerloss tangent (valid fordielectrics only)
        t_usage is layer usage (i.e. IC RDL or DRIVERlayers, ?future use for id'ing
                                PKG and PCBlayer usages?)
        t_SignalDieConstantDielectric between traces on interior Signal
                            Layers (or nil)
        t_SignalLossTangentDielectric between traces on interior Signal
                            Layers (or nil)
        g_freqDepFileName definesthe name of the frequency dependent data file
                          for thefile. This value will be nil if there is no
                          file namedefined for this layer.
        t_etchFactor defines theetch factor for this layer which is in degrees.
     Note the t_SignalDieConstant andt_SignalLossTangent are nil on PLANE and
     dielectric layers.
     If error is detected, a nil will bereturned.
