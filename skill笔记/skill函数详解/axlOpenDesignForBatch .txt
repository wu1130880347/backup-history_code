  NAME
         axlOpenDesignForBatch - open an Allegrodesign database for batch use
  SYNOPSIS
         axlOpenDesignForBatch(
             ?design t_design
             ?mode t_mode
         )
         ==> t_design/nil
  FUNCTION
         Open a design. The newdesign replaces the current design.
         Since this is for batchusage, commands and menusare not changed.
         If the current design hasunsaved edits, then theuser is asked
         to confirm the discard unless thecurrent design was opened in
         "r" mode (notsupported in this release) or g_mode is "wf". If
         the user cancels theconfirmer, then the function returnsnil and
         the current design is leftopen.
         If t_design is notprovided, then theuser will be prompted for
         the name of the design toopen.
         If t_design does not existon disk, then thestandard Allegro
         Drawing Parameters formwill be presented.
         The designType of the newdesign is set as the same as the
         current design. It can bechanged using axlSetDesignType.
  NEEDS
         t_design                - The name of the new design toedit
         g_mode                  - "w" or "wf" (see above)
                                  add a "l" to disable Allegrofile locking
                                  example: "wl" for no locking
  RETURNS
         axlOpenDesignForBatch  - t_design if opened, or nil if error
  NOTE
         This command functionsessentially exactly the same as the
         Allegro "edit" command, except the t_modecan be set to "wf" in
         order to discard thecurrent edits without confirmation.
         Since confirmation usesstandard Allegro confirmer, the "wf"
         mode is essentially thesame as setting the NOCONFIRM environment
         variable.
         This will void all axl dbidhandles and clear the selection set.
