创建一个  film 记录
  NAME
     axlcreate -    creates a film record in active Allegroboard db
  SYNOPSIS
    axlcreate (
      t_filmname
      (n_rotate_code
       n_x_offset
       n_y_offset
       n_undef_line_width
       n_shape_bound
       n_plot_mode
       n_mirrored
       n_full_contact
       n_supp_unconnect
       n_draw_pad
       n_aper_rot
       n_fill_out_shapes
       n_vector_based
       n_draw_holes
      )
      (lt_layers)
    )
    ->name/nil
  FUNCTION
    This creates a new film record or updates an existingrecord. This function is most
    commonly called through theartwork control form's film record "load" option.
    t_filename = film record name
    l_params is a list consisting of 13 paramters which correspond to the "FilmOptions"
    fields in the film control form (see below for a description ofthe fields).
    lt_layers is the list of layers, each layer is astring  of the form
         '("ETCH/TOP" "VIA/TOP"...)
  CAUTIONS
         The filmname is limited bythe database. Entering a name longer then
         the design allows will return a nil. So theartwork parameter dialog
         for the current name limit.
         All units based parameters (x offset, width, etc) must be specifiedin database
         units NOT design units.Database units are always integers and can be converted
         from designs units by:db_units =
                 design_units *design_accuarcy ** 10
         For example if the design has 2 units of accuracy and you want to a width
         of 12.34 you would specify 1234   
                 (1234 = 12.34 * 10 ** 2)
                     or
                 (1234 = 12.34 * 100)
  NEEDS
    t_filmname - the name of thefilm record to be created
    l_params - list of parameters for the film They are:
        rotate_code - 0, 2, 4, or 6, corresponding to 0, 90, 180, 270 degree rotation
        x_offset - film record blockorigin x offset
        y_offset - film record blockorigin y offset
        undef_line_width - filmrecord undefined line width
        shape_bound - shape boundingbox size
        plot_mode - film record plotmode--boolean; 0 =NEGATIVE, 1 = POSITIVE
        mirrored - flag denoting mirroring
        supp_unconnect - indicatorto not flash unconnectedpads
        draw_pad - indicator to drawpads
        aper_rot - boolean indicatorfor aperture rotation
        fill_out_shapes - booleanindicator to notsuppress shape fill
             This is the the "opposite" of the "suppress shapefill"
             switch in the filmcontrol form (ex:  if suppress shape fill is
             selected, fill_out_shapesshould be 0).  This is named
             this way because it howit is represented within the Allegro database.
             This should be set to 1 for 274X, Barcode and MDA since it isignored by
             these formats inAllegro but but certain 3rd party applications may work
             differently.
        vector_based - booleanindicator for vector-based padbehavior
        draw_holes - booleanindicator for draw holes in pads
    lt_layers - list of layers to include in the fikm
  RETURNS
      the name of the film recordcreated, or nil if failure
  EXAMPLE
    Film control form's film record "save" option iscalled.  This creates a .txt file
    containing the following:
        axlcreate( "TRACE_2" '(0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0) '("ETCH/TRACE_2" "PIN/TRACE_2" "VIACLASS/TRACE_2" ))
