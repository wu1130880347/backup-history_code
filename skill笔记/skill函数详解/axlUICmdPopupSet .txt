  NAME
         axlUICmdPopupSet - Set popup with all items required by a command.
  SYNOPSIS
         axlUICmdPopupSet(r_popup)
         -> r_prevPopup
  FUNCTION
         Sets up a popup menu which has all of the menu items that will be
         required throughout the execution of the command.  This should be
         called during the commands initilization process.  Use of this
         procedure modifies the behavior of axlUIPopupSet so that it grays out
         all popup items that are not in the defined popup.
  NEEDS
         r_popup         Popup handle, obtained by calling axlUIPopupDefine.
                         A nil value will turn off this popup.
  RETURNS
         r_prevPopup     The popup set that was previously defined.
  NOTE
         THIS PROCEDURE DOES THE SAME AS axlCmdPopupSet FOR NON-WXL UI's
         The command popup will be cleared when the skill command terminates.  
         This should occur at the same place where we currently clear/free the
         popup set with axlUIPopupSet (AIXSetCurrentPopup).
         Adds a "cmdPopupId" property to AXL user data.  This is used for
         restoring popup entries whenever the axl command state is restored.
