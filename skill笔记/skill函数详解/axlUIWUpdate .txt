  NAME
         axlUIWUpdate - forces an update of a Window
  SYNOPSIS
         axlUIWUpdate (
                 r_window/nil
         )
         -> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         Forces an update of a Window. If you made several changes to
         a window and are not planning on going back to the main loop
         or doing a Skill call that requires user interaction
         then this call will update a window. This situation can occur
         if you are doing some time consuming processing without
         giving back control to the UI message pump. Only required for
         Bristol based code all other implementations don't do anything.
         To use, make all your window changes then make this call.
         If window id is nil exposes the main window.
  NEEDS
         r_window:       Window id or if nil the main window.
  RETURNS
         t for success, nil for failure (window already closed or not a window)
