  NAME
         axlGetDieStackMemberSet - getdie-stack member data set
  FUNCTION
         axlGetDieStackMemberSet (
         )
         ==> list ofdie-stack member defstructs/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This function returnsa list of defstructs - one for each member
         of the given die stack.
         Only available in SIPproducts.
  NEEDS
         g_stackArg - name or dbid ofthe die stack
  RETURNS
         l_data - List of die-stack member datadefstructs or nil on error
       defstruct fields are:
         dbid                  - dbid of member
         refId                 - member name
         memberType            - one of DSA_DIE, DSA_SPACER, DSA_INTERPOSER
         stackPosition         - integer position of member instack
         layerName             - etch object subclass of member
         nextMemberOnSameLayer -flag indicating next member on same layer
         prevMemberOnSameLayer -flag indicating previous member on same layer
  EXAMPLE
         data = axlGetDieStackMemberSet("DIESTACK1")
         foreach(member data
           printf("refId = %L,memberType = %L\n" member->refId
                                                 member->memberType)
         )
         ==> refId = "FC1", memberType =DSA_DIE
             refId = "IPOSER_1", memberType =DSA_INTERPOSER
             refId = "WB1", memberType =DSA_DIE
             refId = "SPACER_1", memberType =DSA_SPACER
             refId = "WB2", memberType =DSA_DIE
