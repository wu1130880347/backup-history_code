  NAME
         axlExtentDB - extent ofdatabase (symbol or drawing)
  SYNOPSIS
         axlExtentDB(
                 [s_mode]
         )
         ==> l_bBox/nil
  FUNCTION
         Default or 'windowfit modedetermines design type and returns
         bBox extent as follows:
           Drawing extent:
             Computes the layoutextents and returns thesmallest bounding
             box to be used for window-fit.
             Only "lines", "linesegs" and "shapes" are searched on
             selected layers in thefollowing order -
              1) "BOARDGEOMETRY/OUTLINE"
              2) "PACKAGEKEEPIN/ALL"
              3) "ROUTEKEEPIN/ALL"
             The first layer thathas any elements is used to determine
             the layout extents. Ifno elements are found on these layers,
             the design extents arereturned.
           Symbol extent:
              Computes the boundingbox enclosing all objects visible in symbol.
         In 'obstacle mode computes a extent based uponthe first obstacle
           where an object isfound.  This tends to slightly larger then
           the real minimal databasesize. This is what drawing param
           form uses.
  NEEDS
         Nothing/'windowfit  - window fit value (see above)
         'obstacle       - see above
  RETURNS
         l_bBox          - bBox extents
         nil             - On error condition.
  EXAMPLES
         ext = axlExtentDB('windowfit)
        ext = axlExtentDB('obstacle)
