创建一个Group
  NAME
         axlMatchGroupCreate - add a match group
  SYNOPSIS
         axlMatchGroupCreate(
                 t_name
         )==> o_mgdbid
  FUNCTION
         This creates a newmatchgroup.
         If a matchgroup already exists withthis name then nil is returned.
         Match groups need to bepopulated, use axlMatchGroupAdd to populate.
         Empty match groups aredeleted on database save.
         Command fails in producttiers that do not support electrical
         constraints or thesymbol editor.
         If the matchgroup waspartially or completely created via an ecset,
         you can only delete it butit will reappear when an Ecset
         re-flattening is requireddue to modifications in the design. An Ecset
         derived match groupindication is currently not available via
         Skill since it is due toorigin flags stored on the properties.
         You can access list ofmatch groups in database by:
                 axlDBGetDesign()->matchgroup
  RELATIVE_PROPAGATION_DELAYDiscussion
         Match groups can containthe following elements: xnets, nets, and
         pinpairs. If a net is partan xnet, the xnet is addedto the
         match group.
         TheRELATIVE_PROPAGATION_DELAY proeprty can be added to the match
         group, xnet andpinpairs. If you add it to the match group then any
         match group member thatdoes not have the property inherits
         it from the match group.
         Because xnets andpinpairs can belong to multiple match groups,
         a "rpd" attribute exists on thedbid for nets, xnets and pinpairs.
         This attribute is a list oflists where each sub-list contains a
         match group dbid and theRELATIVE_PROPAGATION_DELAY value:
                 rpd = ( (o_mgDbid t_rpdValue) ....)
         Thus if apinpair belongs to 2 match groups, you will see two
         lists which are theinherited. A pinpair in a single match group
         will have a single list oflist. Example a pinpair in MG3 with global
         scope and anoverride of delta/tolerance of 10ns:5% reports:
                 rpd = ((dbid:61315360 "MG3:G:::10ns:5 %"))
         the same pinpair without anoverride will report default match group value
                 rpd = ((dbid:61315360 "MG3:G:AD:AR:0ns:5 %"))
         In both examples thr dbidreferences the match group id (MG3).
         TheRELATIVE_PROPAGATION_DELAY syntax is discussed in the
         Allegro Property ReferenceManual. In general the syntax is:
                 <Match groupname>:<scope>:<pinpair>:<value>
         Adding anddeleting properties to a Match Group or PinPair dbid can
         accomplished usingaxlMatchGroupProp. When creating the property
         value, you MUST include thematch group name but not an explicit
         pinpair. For example, the following addsa RPD property to a match
         group named "MG2":
            axlMatchGroupProp.(mg '("RELATIVE_PROPAGATION_DELAY" "MG2:G:::0 ns:5%"))
         Additional restrictions for thisproperty:      
            - Pinpairs should havethe pinpair section empty ("::").
              Example: "MG2:G:::0 ns:5 %"
            - MatchGroups should notreference an explicit pinpair but,
              if not empty, should be a use apinpair type (e.g. "AD:AR",
              "D:R", etc.)
         For nets and xnets, if youaccess the RELATIVE_PROPAGATION_DELAY
         property, you may see theflattened version. This means if object
         is part of multiple MatchGroups, they all appearconcatenated in
         the property. Any pinpairsthat are part of the net appear as part
         of the property at the net or xnetlevel. This is present to
         support legacy applicationslike netlisters. The "rpd" attribute
         that is dbids forpinpairs, net and xnetswill break this
         concatentation apart. Ifyou you need to modify in these
         situations by axlDBAddProp and axlDBDeleteProp it may effect all
         match groups andpinpairs. It is recommended that you use
         axlMatchGroupProp formodification of the
         RELATIVE_PROPAGATION_DELAY propertyfor all objects.
  NEEDS
         t_name          - name of match group (changed to upper case)
  RETURNS
         nil: error or matchgroup with that name exists
         o_mgdbid: dbid of matchgroup
