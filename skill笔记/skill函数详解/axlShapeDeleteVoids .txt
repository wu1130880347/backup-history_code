  NAME
         axlShapeDeleteVoids - delete voids or allvoids within a shape
  FUNCTION
         axlShapeDeleteVoids(
            o_shapeId
         ) -> t/nil
         axlShapeDeleteVoids(
            o_voidId/lo_voidid
         ) -> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This allows the deletion ofvoids in a shape.
         Supports 3 formsof arguments:
           - a shape which deletesall voids in that shape
           - delete single void
           - delete list ofvoids
         Non-voids in list ofvoids options are silently ignored.
         You cannot delete voidsthat are part of auto-generated shapes.
         If you are making a seriesof modifications to a shape (delete
         and add void or changeits boundary) then youshould wrap
         your calls in axlDBOpenShape & axlDBCreateCloseShape for best
         performance.
  NEEDS
         o_shapeId: if given ashape deletes all voids associated with that                              shape
         o_voidId: deletes the givenvoid
         lo_voidid: deletes the list ofvoids
  RETURNS
         t: deletes voids
         nil: error

  EXAMPLES
         See<cdsroot>/share/pcb/examples/skill/axlcore/ashshape.il
         Assuming you have shapedbid (shapeId) then
         1) delete a singlevoid
                 axlShapeDeleteVoids(car(p->voids))
         2) delete all voids inshape except first
                 axlShapeDeleteVoids(cdr(p->voids))
         3) delete all voids inthe shape
                 axlShapeDeleteVoids(p)
