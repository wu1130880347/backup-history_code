  RETURNS
         t       - Something was removed from the selection set.

  EXAMPLES
         The following example interactively selects all connect lines
         (clines) and vias on a net, subtracts the via dbids from the
         select set, and deletes the remaining dbids in the select set.
         axlClearSelSet()
         axlSetFindFilter(?enabled
                 list( "noall" "equivlogic" "nets" "clines" "vias")
                 ?onButtons list( "all"))
         axlAddSelectPoint()
         axlSetFindFilter(?enabled list( "noall" "vias")
                 ?onButtons list( "all"))
         axlSubSelectAll()
         axlDeleteObject(axlGetSelSet())
         ==> t
         The prompt Enter selection point, is displayed. Only the
         connect lines on the net you have select are deleted--not the
         vias of the net.
