控制某个窗口永久显示
  NAME
         axlUIWPerm - Control permanance of window across db open
  SYNOPSIS
         axlUIWPerm (
                 r_window
                 [t/nil]
         )
         -> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         Normally forms and other windows close automatically when
         another database is opened. This allows this default behavior
         to be overridden.
  CAUTIONS
         Windows are automatically closed when a new database is opened
         for a good reason; the data the window display's may no
         longer apply to the new database. So if this function
         is used you should apply it with this in mind.
         If no second argument is provided returns current state of
         window.
  NEEDS
         r_window:       Window id
         optional 2nd arg:
                 t - set permanent
                 nil - reset permanent
  RETURNS
         returns old value;
  EXAMPLE
     1) open test form & make permanent
         handle = axlFormCreate('testForm "axlform" nil 'testFormCb, t nil)
         axlUIWPerm(handle t)
     2) test if window is permanent
         ret = axlUIWPerm(handle)
