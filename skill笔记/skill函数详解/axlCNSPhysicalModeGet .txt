         axlCNSPhysicalModeGet - inquireconstraint physical modes  (on/off)
  FUNCTION
         axlCNSPhysicalModeGet(
                 nil
         ) ==> ls_constraints

                 s_name/t_name
         ) ==> s_mode/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This fetches the currentphysical drc mode(s). Modes determine
         if a particular constraint is on or off.  These modes apply to
         the entire board. Todetermine the setcurrently supported physical
         modes do a axlCNSPhysicalModeGet(nil).
         The physical mode set may be a subset ofphysical values since
         the implementation mayassociate certain values under a master
         mode. For example, via_list is not a constraint and the diff pair
         mode is under the ecsetdomain.
  CAUTION
         Future releases may add or subtract constraintchecks. The
         axl interface doesguarantee the checks returned by this
         interface will remainconstant from release to release.
  NEEDS
         nil: returns all modes thatare in spacing domain
         'all: returns all checks and current mode
         s_name: symbol name ofcheck.
         t_name: string name ofcheck
  RETURNS
         ls_names: - list of checks (s_name ...)
         lls_names: - list of checks and their mode ((s_name s_mode) ...)
         s_mode: mode 'on, or 'off
