  NAME
     axlCompAddPin
  FUNCTION
     This function add one or more pins to thespecified component.
     Pins are added to thecorresponding component and symbol definition,
     with changes being reflected inall instances of those definitions.
  SYNOPSIS
     axlCompAddPin(o_comp
                   g_absLoc
                   o_pin/lo_pins
     ) => t/nil
  NEEDS
     o_comp         -- Dbid of component instance to which pins should
                       be added.
     g_absLoc       -- If true, locations and rotations for pins are
                       absolutevalues in the design space. If nil,
                       these valuesare relative to the origin of the
                       unmirrored, unrotated symboldefinition.
     o_pin/lo_pins  -- Structure, or list of structures, defining the
                       pins to beadded. These objects are defstructs as
                       definedbelow.
         Defstruct used to define a pin. Usemake_axlCompPinRecord.
         Required Elements are:
             s_pinUse    -- Pin use code for this pin. Must be one of
                 the followingsymbols:
                     UNSPEC, POWER, GROUND, NC, LOADIN, LOADOUT, BI, TRI, OCA, OCL.
             n_swapCode  -- Swap group code for this pin. A swapcode of
                 0 means this pin is not swappable.Otherwise, all pins with the
                 same swap code areswappable. This value is not used for co-design
                 components, as all co-designcomp pins are considered swappable.
             l_location  -- X/Y coordinate location for the pin. Absolute or relative
                 to the symbol def origin, as specified byg_absLoc.
             n_rotation  -- Angular rotation of this pin. Absolute or relative to the
                 symbol def origin, as specified byg_absLoc.
         Optional Elements are:
             pinNumber   -- Physical pin number to assign to thispin.
                 Must be uniqueacross all pins of the component. If no pin
                 number is provided, the pin number willbe computed based on the
                 pin numberingscheme for the component. Ifthe numbering scheme is
                 'Customized', as is the default for co-design objects, then the
                 tool will assignthe first unused integer as the pin's number (1, 2...).
             pinName     -- Logical pin name for the pin. Not used
                 for power/ground pins.If not provided, the pin name for signal
                 pins will be thesame as the physical pin number.
             verilogPort -- Verilogport name for the pin. Not used
                 for power/ground pins. If not provided, the verilog portname will
                 match the logicalpin name.
             net         -- Net name or dbid to assign thispin to when created.
                 If nil, pin will be createdon a dummy net and can beassigned later.
             padstack    -- Padstack name or dbid to use for this pin. If nopadstack
                 is supplied, the padstackalready in use for pins ofthis component
                 will be used for this pin as well.
         Co-design Elements are:
             codesignNet -- Net namefor this pin in thesecondary design space. e.g.
                 For a co-design diein a package, this is the pin'snet in the IC design.
                 For a co-designpackage in a board, this isthe pin's net in the package.
             codesignPad -- Pad/Cellname for this pin in thesecondary design space. e.g.
                 For a co-design diein a package, this is the pin'sLEF bump macro.
                 For a co-designpackage in a board, this isthe pin's padstack in the package.
  RETURNS
     t if the pin(s) were added.
     nil if there was an error adding any of thepins, e.g. if a pin
         would be placed outside theextents of the symbol or drawing.
  NOTES
     If many pins are to be added, it is moreefficient to pass the entire
     list to this function to process them in one call than tocall
     axlCompAddPin with eachindividual pin.
