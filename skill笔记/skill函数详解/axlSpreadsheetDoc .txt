  EXAMPLE
     The following is a simpleexample which creates a small, two-worksheet
     spreadsheet with a fewformatting style definitions and cells which
     use those styles to formattheir contents when the spreadsheet is
     viewed with a tool such asMicrosoft's Excel.
     procedure( spreadsheetExample()
         ; Initialize an empty spreadsheet.
         ; Note that you do not need toprovide a name until you
         ; wish to write the spreadsheet todisk.
         axlSpreadsheetInit()
         ; Define inital, default style.
         ; Styles may be defined at any pointduring the spreadsheet's
         ; construction, but must be definedbefore they are referenced
         ; by any row, column, or cell.
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyle("Default"  nil)
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleProp("Alignment" "Vertical"   "Top")
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleProp("Alignment" "Horizontal" "Left")
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleProp("Alignment" "WrapText"   "1")
         ; Define a second style, derived fromthe Default style, which
         ; will include a thin border outlineand specifies a red
         ; background fill.
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyle("Red" "Red Cell")
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleParent("Default")
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleBorder("Left"   nil "Continuous" "2")
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleBorder("Right"  nil "Continuous" "2")
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleBorder("Top"    nil "Continuous" "2")
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleBorder("Bottom" nil "Continuous" "2")
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleProp("Fill" "Color"   axlSpreadsheetGetRGBColorString(255 0 0))
         axlSpreadsheetSetStyleProp("Fill" "Pattern" "Solid")
         ; Define the first worksheet in thespreadsheet.
         axlSpreadsheetSetWorksheet("First")
         ; With a wider first column
         axlSpreadsheetSetColumnProp(1 "Width" "500")
         axlSpreadsheetDefineCell(1 1 "Default" "String" "Defaultformatted cell")
         axlSpreadsheetDefineCell(1 2 "Red" "String" "Red backgroundcell")
         ; Write the compiled spreadsheet toXML file on disk.
         axlSpreadsheetWrite("spreadsheet.xml")
         ; Close and release the compiledspreadsheet's data.
         axlSpreadsheetClose()
