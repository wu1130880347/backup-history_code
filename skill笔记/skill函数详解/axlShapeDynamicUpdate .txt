更新shape动态形状
  NAME
         axlShapeDynamicUpdate - update dynamicshapes
  FUNCTION
         axlShapeDynamicUpdate(
             o_shapeDbid/nil
             g_force
         ) -> x_ood/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Updates a dynamic shape or, if nil, all dynamic shapesare
         updated. This ignores thecurrent dynamic shape mode setting
         of the design.
         By default, will only updatethe shape if it is out of date
         except if g_forceis t where it updates the shape even if
         it is up to date.
         If g_force is nil theshape is only updated if dbid->fillOOD
         is t. The only shapessupported by this function are those
         wheredbid->shapeIsBoundary is t.
         Update a dynamic shapeincludes voiding, artworksmoothing
         and thermal reliefgeneration.
  NEEDS
         o_shapeDbid - dbid adynamic shape
         g_force - force shape toupdate even if it is up to date.
  RETURNS
         x_ood - ifupdating all returns count of all shapes that
                 failed in updating.If single shape returns 0
                 if updatesuccessful, 1otherwise.
                 nil is return if thereis an error; dbid is not
                 a dynamic shape
  EXAMPLES
         1) force update onedynamic shape
                 axlShapeDynamicUpdate(shapeId, t) -> 0
         2) update all shapesood
                 axlShapeDynamicUpdate(nil nil) -> 0
