获取某点在shape上的信息
  NAME
         axlGeoPointShapeInfo - relation of apoint to a shape
  SYNOPSIS
         axlGeoPointShapeInfo(
             l_point
             o_dbid
         ) ==> (g_state o_dbid)/nil
  FUNCTION
         Given a point and a shapedbid returns relation of point to shape. State may
         be outside, inside or on.Additional dbid is returned in the second argument
         to indicate if void or shapeis involved.
         Return matrix:
                 G_STATE                 O_DBID
                 outside                 nil if outsideshape, void dbid if insidevoid
                 inside                  nil
                 on                      shape dbid if onshape else void dbid
  CAUTIONS
         - Assumes that cross-hatchshapes are solid filled.
         - Rounds point to databaseunits. If database accuracy is 2 and you pass a
           3 decimal place point, we will round it to 2 placesbefore doing the test.
  NEEDS
             l_point     - the point
             o_dbid      - dbid of the shape
  RETURNS
         nil - if an error sinceas an invalid argument
         g_state/o_dbid - see above
