修改数据中的字符串
  NAME
         axlDBChangeText - modify textcharactisitics in the database
  FUNCTION
         axlDBChangeText(
             o_dbid
             t_text
            [r_textOrientation/x_textBlock]
             ?layer t_layer
         )
         ==> l_result/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Modifies a text string inthe layout with the arguments as described
         below. Arguments, t_text and r_textOrientationmay be nil if you
         want to keep currentsettings on the text.
         To move text useaxlTransformObject.
         For renaming refdes thisworks the same as edit text in that it
         checks for the HARD_LOCATIONproperty and will not rename refdes
         if this property is present. If youwant to ignore this property
         use axlRenameRefdes.
  NEEDS
         o_dbid                  - text dbid
         t_text                  - The text string.
         r_textOrientation       - axlTextOrientation structure:
                                 defstruct axlTextOrientation
                                   r_textOrientation ;the orientation of text
                                    textBlock     ;string - text block name
                                   rotation      ;rotation infloatnum degrees
                                   mirrored      ;t-->mirrored,nil --> not mirrored
                                                  ;'GEOMETRY -->only geometry is mirrored.
                                   justify       ;"left","center", "right"
                                   If you are modifing any of these arguments
                                    you must provide all of them, copy the
                                   values that are the same from the existing
                                   text dbid
                                Note: As with all SKILL defstructs, use
                                  constructor function: make_axlTextOrientation
                                  tocreate instances of axlTextOrientation.
                                 Use copy function: copy_axlTextOrientation
                                  to copy instances of axlTextOrientation.
         x_textBlock             - if just changing the text block
  RETURNS
         l_result/nil:         - nil if not created, or a list containing
                                        (car) list of DBID of the text
                                        (cadr) t if DRCs created or nil.
  NOTE
         Do NOT pass a text stringwith newlines.

  EXAMPLE
         Example is text added in axlDBCreateText
            text = car(ret)
         1) change text
              cret = axlDBChangeText( text "Chamferneither sides")
         2) change text block
              cret = axlDBChangeText( text nil 4)
         3) change rotation and text
              axlTextOrientationCopy(text myorient)
              myorient->rotation= 0.0
              cret = axlDBChangeText(text "New text" myorient)
