  NAME
         axlCNSIsLockedDomain - is constraintdomain locked
  FUNCTION
         axlCNSIsLockedDomain(
                 g_domain
         )
         ==> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Returns if a constraint domainis locked. A locked constraint domain
         has the followingcharacteristics:
           - csets can't be edited (although new csetscan be added)
           - any object (e.g. net) level propertyoverrides are ignored.
         
         NOTES:
            - The spacing and sameNet domains arelocked as a single domain.
            - Locking is typicallydone via the techfile. In the techfile, you can
              lock individual csets.If one cset is locked, Allegro treats
              the entire domain aslocked from the DRC perspective. When a domain is
              locked, any object levelproperty constraint override is ignored.
            - If a cset is locked it cannot bemodified (including deleted)
  TIP
         Use axlCnsList(nil) to get a list all domains

  RETURNS
         t if ecset is deleted
         nil - not deleted due to being locked or not an ecset
