  NAME
         axlVisibleUpdate - update items due to change in layer visibility
  SYNOPSIS
         axlVisibleUpdate(
                 t_now
         )
         ==> t
  FUNCTION
         The axlVisible family (as well as the base building block
                     axlSetParam("paramLayerGroup:..."))
         permit the changing layer color and visibility. These
         functions also can be used in conjunction with Find Filter
         interaction to permit filtering of objects by layer via changing
         visibility.
         
         Since it wouldn't be desirable to update the
         display if the Skill application is using the axlVisible functions
         to control item filtering the Skill application must indicate
         display update via axlVisibleUpdate when changing visibilty
         on the user.
         This function will also update any forms that display color or
         visibilty to the user.
         For most situations pass nil to this function. This
         defers updating the main graphics canvas until control is
         returned to the user which may allowing combining several
         canvas updates into one.
  NEEDS
         t if update now
         nil if update when control is returned to user
  RETURNS
         t       - always
  EXAMPLE
         Example scenerio for selecting items using visibility without
         updating display:
             ;; You should not interact with user when you have
             ;; visibility modified
             ; get current visibility
             p = axlVisibleGet()
             axlVisbleDesign(nil)  ; turn off all layers
             ;;... change visiblity of selected layers ...
             ;;... Selection of objects without user interaction ...
             ; restore visibilty
             axlVisibleSet(p)
         Example to update display after changing visibilty
             ;; only leave top etch layer on
             axlVisibleLayer("etch" nil)
             axlVisibleLayer("etch/top" t)
             ; update display when control is returned to user
             axlVisibleUpdate(nil)
         Example to change color on top etch layer
             p = axlGetLayer("etch/top")
             ; legal numbers are 1 to 24
             p->color = 10
             axlSetParam(p)
             ; make this call after you change all colors and visibility
             axlVisibleUpdate(t)
