  SYNOPSIS
         This deletes the indicateditem in the list. You can delete
         by a string or by position.Deleting by string works the
         best if the all items areunique. Position can be probalmatic
         if you have the list sort items you add toit.
         If you need to supportdeleting multiple items, it is faster
         to call this interface witha list of items.
