生成device文件
NAME
     axlWriteDeviceFile - dump 3rd party device file for a component definition
  SYNOPSIS
     axlWriteDeviceFile(
         o_compDefDbid
         [t_output_dir])
     ==> t/nil
     
  FUNCTION
     Given a component definition, this function dumps out a third
     party device file. If no directory or nil given writes to current
     directory otherwise writes to given directory.
     Name of the file is compDef->deviceType in lower case with a .txt
     extension. For example if component definition (compDef) device
     type is CAP1 then the device file name will be "cap1.txt".
     Will also create a devices.map which is normally empty unless
     the device name has characters that are not legal as a filename.
     See netin documentation for device file syntax. Normally if
     running Cadence Front-end Schematic packages this interface
     should not be used.
  CAUTION
     Will overwire existing <device> and devices.map in the directory.
  NEEDS
     o_compDefDbid - the component definition of the device file to write out.
     t_output_dir - the output directory of where to write the files.
                    optional - current directory is assumed
  RETURNS
     t   - on success
     nil - on failure, typical failures
                 - dbid is not a component
                 - directory does not exist or is not writable
