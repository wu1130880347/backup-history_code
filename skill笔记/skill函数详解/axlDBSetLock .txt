  SYNOPSIS
         This provides a mechanismto lock the database against future
         changes. If you lock thedatabase it is locked in memory, you
         must save the database todisk to save the lock. With this
         in mind, after locking thedatabase, you are given one
         save of the database beforesave rejects an attempt to save
         the database.
         When the database is lockedthe user will be warned upon opening
         the database that it islocked. Saving the database will
         fail with the exception ofabove and uprev (see below).

                 to unlock the database.Password must be 20characters

                 in the locking userinterface
           exports - default is toallow exporting data to other
                 formats. Ifdisabled the following exports are
                 prevented: techfilewrite, dump_libraries, create modules.
         Uprev-ing the database fromone database version to the next
         ignores the lock flag.
