  SYNOPSIS
         This locks or unlocks aconstraint set in the givendomain.
         See discussion in axlCNSIsLockedDomain.
         You should usually lock or unlock the entiredomain since this matches
         the DRC user model. Weprovide this interface to temporary unlock a locked
         cset, make changes then reapply the lock.
   NOTE
         Changing the lock on a csetcan take a considerable amount of time
         since DRC needs to beupdated. In the spacing domain, dynamic shapes need
         to be updated. If doingother changes, consider cloaking (axlDBCloak
         the entire process. This API alreadyuses cloaking for theindividual cset.
