  NAME
         axlDBAddProp - add or more properties toan object
  FUNCTION
         axlDBAddProp(
                 lo_attach
                 ll_name_value
                 )
         ==> l_result/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Adds all the property/valuepairs listed in ll_name_value to all
         the object dbids listed inlod_attach. If a particular object
         does not accept a particularproperty name in ll_name_value,
         axlDBAddProp silently ignoresthat combination, and continues. If
         an object already has thespecific property attached, axlDBAddProp
         silently replaces itsoriginal value with the one specified in
         ll_name_value.
         If any errors occur or if axlDBAddProp has not added nor changed
         any properties, it returns nil.
  NEEDS
         lo_attach:      List of Allegro object dbids to which to add the        
                        property/value combinations listed in ll_name_value.
                         A list of nil denotes attachmentto the design
                         (list nil). However, if lo_attach if nil, means no
                         objects for attachment, and axlDBAddProp does
                         nothing and returns nil.
         ll_name_value:  List of property-name/property-value pairs as   
                         lists.  If the car of this list is not a list,
                         then axlDBAddProp treatsll_name_value as a single
                         name-valuelist. The car of each name-valuepair is
                         theproperty name as a string. The cadr of the
                         name-value list is the propertyvalue. It is either
                         a stringwith or without unitsincluded, or a
                         simplevalue (fixed or floating). In either case,
                         if the value does not include units explicitly,
                         then axlDBAddProp uses the unitsspecified in the
                         system units.dat file.
         axlDBAddProp ignores the value if the property data type is BOOLEAN.
  RETURNS
         l_result/nil:   nil if no properties were added. Otherwise it   
                         returns alist:
                         * (car) list of dbids of objectsthat had at least
                           one property successfully added
                         * (cadr) always nil.
