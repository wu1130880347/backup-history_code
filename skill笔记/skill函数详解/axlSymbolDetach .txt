NAME
         axlSymbolDetach - Remove an object to a symbol instance
  SYNOPSIS
         axlSymbolDetach(
                 o_symInstDbid
                 o_dbid/lo_dbid/g_mode
         )
         ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         Unlinks objects from the given symbol instance.
         For pin escapes, two special modes are provided to detach all or most
         symbol etch from a given symbol instance.
         It only unlinks an object from a symbol if it matches the provided
         symbol instance.
         See axlSymbolAttach for the rules.
  CAUTION
         Running refresh_symbol result results in duplicate objects as the detached
         objects are loaded again.
  NEEDS
         o_symInstDbid   - symbol instance to modify.
         o_dbid - dbid to unlink from symbol
         lo_dbid - list of dbids to unlink from symbol
         g_mode - special modes for unlinking all "etch" from symbol
                 'allEtch - deassign all etch from symbol
                 'allClineVia - design all etch except for shapes from sybmol
  RETURNS
         t       - was able to change symbol
         nil     - otherwise

  EXAMPLES
         Examples use ashOne which is a shareware utility that allows user to select
         an object (see <cdsroo>/share/pcb/examples/skill/ash-fxf/ashone.il)
         - Typical method: To get the symdbid from the object:
             - if etch
                 symdbid = dbid->symbolEtch
             - if nonetch
                 symdbid = dbid->parent
             symdbid = ashOne("SYMBOLS")
             dbid = ashOne("NOALL")
             ret = axlSymbolDetach(symdbid, dbid)
         - Dessign all etch from symbol except shapes
             symdbid = ashOne("SYMBOLS")
             ret = axlSymbolDetach(symdbid, 'allClineVia)
