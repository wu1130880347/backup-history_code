  FUNCTION
         axlDBControl(
                 s_name

  SYNOPSIS
         Inquires and/or sets thevalue of a special database control.
         If setting a value, the return is the old value ofthe control.
         A side effect of most ofthese controls is if a form is active that
         is displaying the currentsetting it may not beupdated. Additional
         side effects of individualcontrols are listed.
         Note: Display several display options have beenmoved to
         axlDBDisplayControl but for backwardcompatibility are still
         supported via thisinterface.
