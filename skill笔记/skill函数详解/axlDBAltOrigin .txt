  NAME
         axlDBAltOrigin - return alternative center for a dbid
  FUNCTION
         axlDBAltOrigin(
                 g_mode
                 o_dbid
         ) -> xy/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This provides Skill accessto the move command's origin point
         option in the Optionspanel.
         It is intended for symbols instances (it will convert acomp
         instance to its symbol).  Body origin rules for symbols, origin
         is first the first rulethat is met:
           1) the origin of texton the PACKAGE_GEOMETRY/BODY_CENTER layer
           2) the center of anextent box created by the union of all shapes on
                 layersPACKAGE_GEOMETRY (PLACE_BOUND_TOP, PLACE_BOUND_BOTTOM,
                 DFA_BOUND_TOP, DFA_BOUND_BOTTOM) and EMBEDDED_GEOMETRY (PLACE_BOUND
                 and DFA_BOUND)
           3) center of thesymbol bbox
         
         Other Allegro figure dbid'scan be supplied  but all options may
         not be supported. For example, a CLINE supportsthe center option
         but not 'origin or 'pin1.
  NEEDS
         g_mode: 'center - return body center ofobject
                 'origin - return origin of object (normally if dbid has
                           an xy attribute this is thesame coordinate)
                           ForSymbols, the board origincan be set by the origin
                           of texton the PACKAGE_GEOMETRY/BODY_CENTER layer.
                 'pin1   - return pin1 as center
         o_dbid: a figure (geometric object) dbid
  RETURNS
         xy: location requested
         nil: not a dbid, dbid is not a figure dbid, or mode is not supported
                 for that object

  EXAMPLES
         ; ashOne is a utility supplied in theexamples Skill code
         sym = ashOne()
         ; select symbol in Find filter and select a symbol
         sym->xy
         ; prints (3503.0 1058.0)
         axlDBAltOrigin('origin sym)
         ; prints (3503.0 1058.0) -- origin ofsymbol is same as xy
         axlDBAltOrigin('center sym)
         ; prints (3250.0 1737.0)
         axlDBAltOrigin('pin1 sym)
         ; prints (3503.0 1058.0) -- pin1 ofsymbol is same as its xy
