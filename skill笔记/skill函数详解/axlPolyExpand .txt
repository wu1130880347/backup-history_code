  NAME
         axlPolyExpand - expands a polygon
  FUNCTION
         axlPolyExpand (
                 o_polygon1/lo_polygon1
                 f_expandValue
                 s_expandType
                 )
         ==> lo_polygon/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This function yieldsthe list of polys after expanding them
         by a specified distance.Use of a negative number causes
         contraction. The distancespecified is taken in user units. Will
         not allow hole polys asinput. When holes are passed as input,
         the following warning isdisplayed:
            Invalid polygon idargument -<argument>
         Cautions:
           - Underlying logicalop function failsin rare dense geometrical
             situation. nil isreturned in that case.
           - 'ALL_ARC mode may haveround-off issues when shape has very small
             arc segments.
        Trimming options are (s_expandType):
         'NONE        - no corner modifications
         'ACU_ARC     - Trim inside acute (less then 90 degrees) line/line
                         cornerswith arcs and always chamfer spikes. No obtuse or
                         right angletrimming is done.
         'ACU_BLUNT   - Trim acute inside corners and spikeswith line segments.
         'ALL_ARC     - Trim inside and outside line/line, line/arc and
                         arc/arccorners with respect to these angle rules:
                         - All acuteangles are trimmed.
                         - Mostobtuse angles (more then 135 degrees) are trimmed.  
                         - 90 degreecorners are trimmed.
                         Finally always chamfer spikes.
  NOTE:
         Poly expansion with 0 and no trimis returns the input poly NOT a list:  
                 axlPolyExpand(poly 0.0 'NONE) -> o_polygon
  NEEDS
         o_polygon1 / lo_polygon1
         o_polygon / list ofo_polygons on which the operation is to be done.
         f_expandValue:  Amount of expansion in user units
         s_expandType:   Symbol specifying the exterior corners ofthe geometry
                         duringexpansion (see above)
  RETURNS
         lo_polygon/nil:         Returns a list of o_polygons whichrepresent
                                 theresulting geometry after performing the
                                expansion on the polys passed as arguments. In
                                 case of an error, it returns nil.
         To be more specific,
         (o_polygon_out1  o_polygon_out2  ...) is returned if the result after
         performing the operation isa list of polys.
         (nil) is returned if theresult after performing the operation is
         a nil poly, that is considercontracting a 20x30 rectangle by 40 units.
         nil is returned if theoperation fails. A descriptive error message
         can be obtained by calling axlPolyErrorGet().
  EXAMPLES
         poly_list = axlPolyFromDB(shape_dbid)
                 exp_poly = axlPolyExpand(poly_list10.0 'ALL_ARC)
