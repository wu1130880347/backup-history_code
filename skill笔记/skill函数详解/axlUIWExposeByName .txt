NAME
         axlUIWExposeByName - exposes a possibly hidden window by name
  SYNOPSIS
         axlUIWExposeByName (
                 t_windowName
         )
         -> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         Finds window by name and exposes it (raises it to top of
         window stack and will de-iconify it if iconify).
         Allegro window names can be obtained via scripting by using
         the setwindow command argument. If a form you should remove the
         "form." prefix to obtain the name.
         
         CAUTION: The name of windows may change from release to release.
                 Thus names passed to this function may not
         
         If you wish to raise an item in the control panel (e.g. Options)
         use the axlControlRaise() function.
            
  NEEDS
         t_windowName:   window name -- see above
  RETURNS
         t if found window and nil if not found
