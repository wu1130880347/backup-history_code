  NAME
     axlShoveSetParams - set theparameters used for shoving
  FUNCTION
     axlShoveSetParams (
         l_params
     ) ==> nil
  SYNOPSIS
     This function sets the parametersused for shoving by the axlShoveItems
     function. If you do not provideall of the values then the indicated
     default is used.
  NEEDS
     l_params - This is a listcontaining the desired parameters.
              It is of the form:
                 (shoveMode cornerTypegridded smooth oop samenet)
              shoveMode - Can be oneof the following integer values:
                  0 - hugpreferred - items passed in will try to mold
                        around itemsthey are in violation with (default)
                  1 - shovepreferred - items passed in will try to shove
                        items theyare in violation with
              cornerType - Can beone of the following integer values:
                  90 - for 90 degreecorners. (default)
                  45 - for 45 degreecorners.
                  0  - for any angle corners.
              gridded - Can be oneof the following integer values
                  0 -ignore grids (default)
                  1 -performs shoves on grid
              smooth - Do smoothingof shoved traces
                  0 - nosmoothing (default)
                  1 -minimal smoothing
                  2 - moresmoothing
                  3 - stillmore smoothing
                  4 - full smoothing
              oops - Abort the shoveif DRCs result
                  0 - oopsoff (default)
                  1 - oops if drcsare left over
              samenet - Test for samenet violations.  Note that at the
                        present time,  this results in a post-shove check for
                        drcs that ismeaningful only if you also set oops
                        to the "oops ifdrcs" value.
                  0 - nosame net tests (default)
                  1 -enable same net DRC checking
  RETURNS
     t/nil Returns t ifsuccessfull, nil if not.
  EXAMPLE
     The following example function setsthe shove parameters to shove
     preferred, 45 degreemode, and snap togrid:
         (defun SetParams ()
         (let (params (shoveMode 1) (cornerType 45) (gridded 1))
             params = list(shoveMode cornerTypegridded)
             axlShoveSetParams(params)
         ))
