         axlMPythag - distance betweentwo points
  FUNCTION
         axlMPythag(
                 l_pt1
                 l_pt2
         ) -> f_distance/nil

         The l_ptN is an x:ycoordinate.
  NEEDS
         l_pt1, l_pt2: 2 xypoints
  RETURNS
         f_distance: distancebetween points
         nil: arguments were not xypoints
