  FUNCTION
     axlGetMetalUsageForLayer(
                 l_layers
                 [l_extents]

                 )
         ==> resultStruct/nil
  SYNOPSYS
     This function compute thepercentage metal coverage on the layers specified
     in l_layer(s) (combination of alllayers listed) in the areaspecified in
     l_extents. If no extents areprovided, then thedrawing's substrate geometry
     outline extents will be used.
  
     Negative layer metal coveragecan be computed by passing nil for g_positive,
     if processing negativeartwork layers such as solder mask layers.
     
  NEEDS
     l_layers - A single layer or list oflayers to compute the (combined) metal
                usage on. Forexample, passing list("CONDUCTOR/TOP" "PIN/TOP")
                will compute thecoverage of all conductor + pin objects on the top
                layer. It will not computethe two individually.
     l_extents - BBox region tocompute metal coverage in. If not supplied, the tool
                 will compute basedon the substrate geometry outline's extents or,
                 if nooutline is present, thedatabase extents.
     g_positive - Whether the layer(s) being processed arepositive or negative
                  layers. Defaultsto true.
  RETURNS
     resultStruct/nil - resultStructis a defstruct containing for elements:
             areaUnits - Units in which thearea was computed and returned.
             regionArea - The areaof the extents region the tool used (user
                           supplied or drawingextents).
             metalArea  - The total metal area in the region checkedon the
                          layersindicated.
             percentMetalCoverage -The percentage of the extents region covered
                                    by metal ((metalArea / regionArea) * 100.0)
         nil is returned if thereis an error, with error printed to command line.
