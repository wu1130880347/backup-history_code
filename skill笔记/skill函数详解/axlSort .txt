  NAME
      axlSort - Sorts thecontents of a file.
  SYNOPSIS
      axlSort (
          t_infile
          t_outfile
          [t_sortfields]
          [t_sort_options]
      ) -> t/nil
  FUNCTION
      This function sorts the contentsof a given input file, and places
      the results in the outputfile. No warning is given if the output
      file overwrites an existingfile - checking must be done by the caller
      of this function.
      The default sort is aleft to right, ASCII ascending sort of theinput file,
      with duplicate lines left in.The sort behavior can be controlled with
      the two optional parameters:
      t_sortfields: A stringcontaining directives controlling which fields
          to use as sort keys, the sort orderof those fields, and how to
          interprete the data type of thefield for sorting. The string contains
          a series of triplets:
              field_number sortOrderfieldType
          Multiple triplets can becontained within the string, separated by
          commas. The valid inputs for eachelement of the triplets are:
          field_number - a numberrepresenting the position of the field on
              the line, from left to right.Numbering starts a 1.
          sortOrder    - A   (Ascending sort order)
                         D    (Descending sort order)
          fieldType    - A   (Alpha)
                         I    (Integer)
                         F    (Float)
          An example of a t_sortfieldstriplet:
              "3 A A,5 D I,1A F"
          which means: Sort basedon:
                the third field, ascending, field type ASCII,
                the fifth field, descending, field type Integer,
                the first field, ascending, field type Float
     t_sort_options: A stringcontaining directives controlling the global
         sort parameters. The sort optionscan appear in any order, and must be
         separated by commas. Theavailable options are:
         
         Field Delimiter: Supported delimiters include anycharacter in
             punctuation characterclass (except comma).
         U - Remove duplicate lines (default is to leaveduplicate lines)
        
         D - Descending order (default is ascending)
         An example of thet_sort_options string:
             "!,U"
         Which means: use the '!'character as the field delimiter, and
         remove any duplicatelines.
  RETURNS
      t - If the sort wassuccessful, nil if not.
  EXAMPLES
  Given the input file containing:
2!3!4!5!6
2!3!4!5!6
5!6!7!8!9
5!1!7!8!9
2!2!3!4!5
1!2!3!4!5
3!4!5!6!7
4!5!6!7!8
(axlSort "input.txt" "output.txt" nil "!,U")
yields:
1!2!3!4!5
2!2!3!4!5
2!3!4!5!6
3!4!5!6!7
4!5!6!7!8
5!1!7!8!9
5!6!7!8!9
and (axlSort "input.txt" "output.txt" "2 A I,1 DI" "!")
yields:
5!1!7!8!9
2!2!3!4!5
1!2!3!4!5
2!3!4!5!6
2!3!4!5!6
3!4!5!6!7
4!5!6!7!8
5!6!7!8!9
