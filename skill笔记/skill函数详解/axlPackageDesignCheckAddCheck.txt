  FUNCTION
     This function will register a newcheck in the specified category of
     the IC Packaging tools' "packageintegrity" command check tree.
     
     You must define acategory before adding checks to it. So, this
     function should always becalled after axlPackageDesignCheckAddCategory.
     A newly added check will beinserted into the tree in alphabetically
     sorted order. Therefore, you do not need tomanage the order checks
     are added by yourself.
     
     s_runCommand is the skill function which shouldbe called if this
     check is selected to run. This function MUSTadhere to the following
     guidelines:
         #1: It must take exactlyone argument, which iswhether to
             fix errorsit encounters or not.
         #2: It must return aninteger value for how many errors
             were found in thedatabase.
         #3: It must call thefollowing functions:
               axlPackageDesignCheckLogError(<error string> <fixed>) and
               axlPackageDesignCheckDrcError(<error location> <dbids>)
             to report any errors it finds.
     These restrictions are imposedto ensure that output is consistent
     across all checks run by thiscommand.
