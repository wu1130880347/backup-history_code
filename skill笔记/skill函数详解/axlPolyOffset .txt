偏移一个多边形
  NAME
         axlPolyOffset - shift polycoordinates
  FUNCTION
     axlPolyOffset (
         o_polygon/lo_polygon
         l_xy
         [g_copy]
     )
     => o_polygon
  SYNOPSIS
      This offsets the entire polyby the provided xy coordinate. Optionally
      if g_copy is t it willcopy the poly, default is to offset the provided
      poly.
      The offseted polygon must beentirely within the extents of the drawing.
  NEEDS
      o_polygon    - o_polygon on which the operation is tobe done.
      lo_polygon   - optionally pass a list of polys
      l_xy         - coordiates in user units for offset.
      g_copy       - optional, if t doesthe offset on a copy
  RETURNS
      lo_polygon/
      o_polygon - in place offset (g_copy nil) oroffseted copy of polygond
                  (g_copy is t). If passed a list ofpolys returns a list
                  otherwise return a poly.
