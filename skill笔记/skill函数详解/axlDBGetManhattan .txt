获得网络的曼哈顿长度
  NAME
     axlDBGetManhattan - given a net return etch, path and manhattan lengths
  SYNOPSIS
     axlDBGetManhattan(
         o_dbid_net
     )
     ==> l_result/nil
  FUNCTION
                 Given a netcalculates both a etch, path and manhattan length.
                 Result is the sameas that used by listelement.
                 Etch is current length of etch present
                         is 0 when no etch
                 Path is etch plus remaining
                         is equal to etch when net is fullyconnected
                         is equal to manhattan when net has no etch
                 Manhattan -estimated routing length
  NEEDS
     o_dbid      - net dbid
  RETURNS
     nil         - Not a net dbid.
                   Net is out ofdate
                   No ratsnest
     l_result    - (etchLength path manhattan)
