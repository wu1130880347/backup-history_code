  NAME
         axlDBGridSet  - set the design grid
  SYNOPSIS
         axlDBGridSet(
                 og_grid
         )
         ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         This modifies the gridsettings in the design.
         
         In addition to the gridnames (see axlDBGridGet), two symbolic
         grid names are available:
            'all - sets all gridvalues
            'etch - sets all ETCHgrid values
         
         As a convenience when setting a singlethe xGrids or yGrids attribute,
         you can use a float.
         Both xMajor and yMajor values areautomatically determined by the sum
         of the spacings in xGrids and yGridsrespectively.
  NOTES
         - Non etch grids may not have multiplespacings. We only use the
           first grid seen.
         - Setting grids is not undo-able (this may change inthe future).
         - Etch grids names are thesame as ETCH layer names. This may
           change in the future.
         - Origin values must bewithin drawing extents or 0.
         - If Grid dialog is open it will not be updated if you change the grid
           settings via this API.
  NEEDS
         og_grid - a griddisembodied property list from axlDBGetGrid
  RETURNS
         t if changed grid, nil if failure

  EXAMPLES
         1) Modify TOP grid settings
             grid = axlDBGridGet("TOP")
             grid = axlDBG
         2) Modify all grids ( note allow xGrids and yGrids to NOT be list)
             grid = axlDBGridGet("TOP")
             grid->name = 'all
             grid->xGrids = 5.0
             grid->yGrids = 5.0
             axlDBGridSet(grid)
         3) Modify all etch grids
             grid = axlDBGridGet("TOP")
             grid->name = 'etch
             grid->xGrids = '(5.0 7.0)
             grid->yGrids = '(5.0 6.0)
             axlDBGridSet(grid)
