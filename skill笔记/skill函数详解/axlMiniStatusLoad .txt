  SYNOPSIS
         Loads the ministatus formwith the form file provided in this
         call. This functionreplaces the ministatus contents. This
         function is a special case ofaxlForms. See AXL Functional
         Spec for detaildescription of how AXL forms work.
         When the Command isfinished, Allegro restoresthe ministatus
         contents to the defaultvalues. For command to work properly
         you need to make one of theseveral axl Event calls to process
         user picks.
         Two reserved field namesare available;
                 class    -- enumerated list of CLASS layers
                 subclass --enumerated list of SUBCLASS layers for
                                current active class
         If you make use of thesefields use support changing the active
         class andsubclass you also get (for free) color swatch support.
         The Form file fragmentshown below can be added to you ministatus
         form file to get thatsupport. The "subcolor" field is optional.
         You should adjust theposition (FLOC) of the fields tosuite your
         form layout.
         Note using these reservednames will also cause axlGetActiveLayer
         to update when userchanges the layer.
