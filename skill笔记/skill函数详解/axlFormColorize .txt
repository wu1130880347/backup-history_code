  NAME
         axlFormColorize - Override default text or background color on a control
  SYNOPSIS
         axlFormColorize(
             o_form
             t_field
             g_option
             g_color
         ) ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         This allows the override of the background and/or text color
         of a control. Only the following controls are supported:
         STRFILLIN, READFILLIN, LONGFILLIN, INTSLIDEBAR, ENUMSET,
         CHECKLIST and TEXT (or INFO). Names used are those found
         in the form BNF file syntax.
         By default these controls use the default system colors.  
         To override these colors the following options are provided
            'background          set background of control
            'text                set text of control
         
         The g_color argument is either a color symbol (for non DB
         options), a number for DB color options or nil (for restoring
         to system default. The allowed values can be found in axlColorDoc.
         Other form controls support color as a fundamental part
         of their interface. These are COLOR (axlFormDoc) and GRID
         (axlFormGridDoc) controls.
         The following restrictions exist:
            - setting the same or close text and background colors
                 can cause read-ability problems
            - setting the background of CHECKLIST controls is not
                 supported on UNIX.
            - fillins with popups do not correct show color.
  NEEDS
