  FUNCTION
         axlUIConfirm(

  SYNOPSIS
         Displays the string t_message in a confirmer window.
         This function is a blocker. The user must respond before any further
         interaction with Allegro. This function is useful mainly for informing
         the user about a severe fatal error before exiting your program. You
         should use it very rarely.
         The optional s_level argument changes the info displayed to the user.
         Note: if environment variable, noconfirm is set causes an immediate
                 return.
  NEEDS
         t_message:      Message string.
         s_level: option level symbol; default is info level, other levels
                 are 'warn and 'error.
  RETURNS
         t:      Always returns t.
