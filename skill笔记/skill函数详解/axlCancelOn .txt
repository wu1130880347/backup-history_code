  NAME
         axlCancelOn - control-Cinterface
         axlCancelOff - control-Cinterface
         axlCancelTest - control-Cinterface
  SYNOPSIS
         Allows Skill code to test for user cancel.
         When cancel is enabled thetraffic light will change to yellow.
         Cancel calls are nestablebut you should always make as
         many off calls as on calls.To avoid problems always
         place the cancelon/off callpairs in the same function.
         These calls do not work from the Skillor Allegro command
         line since Allegro willimmediately disable cancel when
         exiting the Skillenvironment to prevent the system
         from hanging.
         Caution: Only enable cancel processing when you are doing
         no user interaction. Havingcancel enabled when theuser
         has to enter infomation is not supported and will hang the
         system.
         Caution: Should exercisecaution in how ofter axlCancelTest is
         called as it could cause aperformance impact to your program.
         The actual canceltest isvery low overhead but the conversion from
         Skill to C to do the test will causea performance impact.
