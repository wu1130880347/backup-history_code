  NAME
         axlNetEcsetValueGet - get anelectrical constraint associated with a net
  FUNCTION
         axlNetEcsetValueGet(
                o_itemDbid/t_netName
                 t_cnsName/s_name
         )
         ==> t_cnsValue/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This routine returns thevalue of a specific electrical constraint that
         as been assigned to a givennet. Both fixed and user defined constraints
         may be accessed.
         
         This will not return a "flattened" net view ofconstraints applied to
         pinpairs. Use axlCnsNetFlattened to obtain this constraint view.
  TIPS
         If requesting multipleconstraints from the same net is is faster to
         obtain get thedbid of thet net and pass that as first argument instead
         of using the net name.
  NEEDS
         o_itemDbid - the dbid ofany item that that is assigned to a net or Xnet.
         t_cnsName - the propertyname for the constraint to be fetched. This can
                     be either afixed constraint or a user defined constraint.
         s_name - symbol name of DRCcheck (values returned by
                         axlCNSEcsetModeGet(nil). These names may not
                         exactlymatch the property name. They do not exist
                         for userdefined properties in the ecset.
  RETURNS
         t_cnsValue - the valuereturned as a string
         nil - no value defined for the net

  EXAMPLES:
         1) net is part of anECSET (electricalconstraint set) which has
                 aMAX_EXPOSED_LENGTH constraint
             net = car(axlSelectByName("NET" "NET2")
             rule = axlNetEcsetValueGet(net "MAX_EXPOSED_LENGTH")
         2) net has an overridecontraint for MAX_VIA_COUNT
              rule = axlNetEcsetValueGet("NET2" "MAX_VIA_COUNT")
         3) same as example 2 but usethe DRC check name
              rule = axlNetEcsetValueGet("NET2" 'Maximum_Via_Count)
