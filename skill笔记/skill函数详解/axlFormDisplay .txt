  NAME
         axlFormDisplay - displays form and optionally waits for close of form by user
  FUNCTION
         axlFormDisplay(
                 r_form
                 )
         ==> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This function displays the form r_form already created by
         axlFormCreate. For a better looking display, set all the field values
         of the form before calling axlFormDisplay. If the form is blocking,
         axlFormDisplay blocks until the user closes the form.
         If the form has already been displayed, then axlFormDisplay simply
         exposes the form.
  NEEDS
         r_form: the form dbid
  RETURNS
         t/nil: returns t if it successfully displays form. Return of
                 nil if form could not be displayed.
