  NAME
         axlSubclassFormPopup - create popup of subclasses for given class
  FUNCTION
         axlSubclassFormPopup(
                 r_form
                 t_field
                 t_class
                 nil/lt_subclass
         ) -> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         For a given Allegro class build a form popup for given field
         of r_form. This is a combination of axlGetParam and
         axlFormBuildPopup with color swatching.
         If fourth argument is nil base it upon all subclasses of
         given class. List of subclasses can also be provided.
         One of its major uses is to easily build a subclass popup
         containing a their current colors as a swatches. If you desire
         this functionality then in the form file for that field(s) you
         need to add (note only ENUMSET field types support this option).
                 OPTIONS ownerdrawn
         Popups built in this way are dispatched back to the application
         as strings.
         Note: if list of subclasses are passed, illegal subclass names are
                 silently ignored.
  TIP
         To take advantage of color swatches in your subclass pulldown (ENUMSET)
         use this interface and the ownerdrawn option in the form file. The
         form file entry for your control should look like:
             FIELD <field name>
             FLOC <x y location>
             ENUMSET <width of field>
             OPTIONS prettyprint ownerdrawn
             POP <popup name>
             ENDFIELD
         Note prettyprint option upper/lower cases the popup name the user sees.
  NEEDS
         r_form: standard form hanle (see axlFormCreate)
         t_field: field name in form or popup name of form
         t_class: class name
         nil/lt_subclass: if nil all members of class else
                 provided list is used.
  RETURNS
         t if successfully did it, nil failed
