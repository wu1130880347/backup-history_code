获得某环境变量列表
  NAME
         axlGetVariableList - get currentsetting of environment variable
  FUNCTION
         axlGetVariableList(
                 t_variable/nil
                 )
         ==> t_value/lt_value/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Requests the value of thespecified Allegro environment variable,
         t_variable. Unlike axlGetVariable this will return a list
         of strings if thevariable is an array such as one of Allegro's
         path variable. If variable is a singleitem the return is the
         same as axlGetVariable.
         Since path variables cancontain spaces, using the axlGetVariable
         interface and then Skill'sparseString to break them back in their
         component pieces will not givethe correct result.
         Variable names are caseinsensitive.
         Note: Variable names/valuescan change from release to release.
  NEEDS
         t_variable:     the name of the Allegro environment variable.
         nil:    if nil returnsa list of all set variables in Allegro
  RETURNS
         t_value/nil:    the string value of the Allegro environmentvariable.
                         Returns nil if thevariable is not set.
         lt_names: if passed nil returnslist of variable names
