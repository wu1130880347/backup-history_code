设定的路线平滑参数
  NAME
     axlSmoothSetParams - set routesmoothing params
  SYNOPSIS
     axlSmoothSetParams (
         l_params
     ) ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
     Sets the parameters used forsmoothing. All parameters must be supplied but
     a nil as a parameteroption will leave the existing setting.
     The smooth functionality isprovided on an "as-is" basis. It works well
     on many designs put has thefollowing restrictions:
         - not diffpair aware.
         - may have issues withelectrically constrained nets
     TIP: See axlDBIgnoreFixed if you want to temporary disable FIXEDtesting.
  NEEDS
     params - List containing theparameters, the list is ofthe form:
                 (cornerTypemaxCornerLength padEntryRestriction
                                            minPadEntryLength sortDirection)
              cornerType - Can beone of the following string values:
                  "90" - for 90 degreecorners.
                  "45" - for 45 degreecorners.
                  "0"  - for any angle corners.
                  "-1" - for arccorners.
              maxCornerLength - Thisis an integer value indicating the
                  maximum length of a bubble or jog indbunits.  A negative
                  value indicatesUNLIMITED.
              padEntryRestriction -Can be one of the following string values:
                  "2" - Indicates thatthere are no restrictions.
                  "1" - Indicates thatall pad entry segments be fixed.
                  "0" - Indicates thatthe entry segments for all rectangular
                        pads befixed.
              minPadEntryLength -This is an double value indicating the
                  minimum length offixed pad entry segments in user units.
                  If a pad entrysegment is longer than this length, it will
                  be broken at or nearthat point so that smoothing can occur
                  on that segment.  A negative value indicates UNLIMITED.  This
                  value is notapplicable if padEntryRestriction is "2".
              sortDirection - Thisindicates how the clines are to be sorted
                  before smoothingbegins.  This can be one of the following
                  integer values:
                  0 - Nosorting.
                  1 - Sortfrom the North.
                  2 - Sortfrom the NorthEast.
                  3 - Sortfrom the East.
                  4 - Sort from the SouthEast.
                  5 - Sortfrom the South.
                  6 - Sortfrom the SouthWest.
                  7 - Sortfrom the West.
                  8 - Sortfrom the NorthWest.
  RETURNS
     t ifsuccessfull, nil if not.
  EXAMPLE
     1) set params
          axlSmoothSetParams(list("45" -1.0 "0" 10.0 0))
     2) Update cornertyp to90
          axlSmoothSetParams(list("90" nil nil nil nil))
