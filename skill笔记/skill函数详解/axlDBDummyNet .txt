  NAME
         axlDBDummyNet - retrieve dummynets
  FUNCTION
         axlDBDummyNet (
               g_mode
         ) -> lo_dbid/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This returns all dummy netsin design.
         Two courtesy options areprovided which are:
          - 'pin for any dummy net that hasa pin return the first pin ofthe
             dummy net
          - 'shape for any dummy net thathas a shape return the first shape of
             the dummy net
         Typically each dummy net indesign will only have a single pin
         or shape but this may not always be the case.Clines or vias cannot,
         by themselves exist on adummy.
         Symbols (dra) do not have dummy nets
  NEEDS
         g_mode: 'pin - return list of 1st pins on dummynets
                 'shape - return list of 1st shapes on dummynets
  RETURNS
         t - success
         nil - failed due to incorrect arguments

  EXAMPLES
         1) Print all 1st pins on dummynets
             foreach( mapc x axlDBDummyNet('pin) printf("%s\n" axlDbidName(x)))
         2) Get all dummy nets on design
             p = axlDBDummyNet(nil)
