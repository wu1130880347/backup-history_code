  NAME
         axlGetIposerData - getspecified interposer data
  FUNCTION
         axlGetIposerData (
             g_iposerId
         )
         ==> iposer-datadefstruct/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This function fetchesthe data for the given iposer and loads
         it into the a defstruct.
         Only available in SIPproducts.
  NEEDS
         g_iposerName - name or dbid ofthe interposer to get the data for
  RETURNS
         iposerData - defstruct with data for the given iposer.
         nil        - iposer does not exist or therewas an error.
     defstruct fields:
         dbid           - dbid of interposer
         refId          - interposer ref-id
         memberType     - DSA_INTERPOSER
         stackName      - parent die-stack name
         stackPosition  - integer position of member instack
         layerName      - etch-object layer (vias/clines/shapes)
         totalThickness - dielectric+ conductor thickness
         stackHeightMin - startingheight within stack
         stackHeightMax - endingheight within stack
         origin         - interposer symbol x/y location
         rotation       - rotation angle in degrees
         extents        - unioned extents of all members instack
         dielMatl       - name of dielectric material used forsubstrate
         dielThickness  - thickness of dielectric material
         condMatl      - name of conductor material used for etch objects
         condThickness  - thickness of conductor material
  EXAMPLE
         data = axlGetDieData("IPOSER_1")
         printf("stack-pos =%L, layer-name = %L, thickness = %L\n"
                data->stackPosition  data->layerName data->totalThickness)
         ==> stack-pos = 4, layer-name = "IP1", thickness = 106.0
