  NAME
     axlDBGetConnect - given a dbid, find all theelements connected to it
  FUNCTION
     axlDBGetConnect(
         o_dbid
         [t_full]
     )
     ==> l_result
  SYNOPSIS
     With second argument nil or not present:
         - For pins, vias or Ts returns list of connectedclines.
         - For path (clines) or line/arc (segments) returns list of objectsconnected
                 to either end.
         - For shapes same ast_full=t
     With second argument t.
         - For pins, vias or Ts returns fullconnectivity which isclines
           shapes, pins, vias or t's.
         - For path (clines) or line/arc (segements) sames as t_full=nil
         - For shapes list of connectedobjects which may be clines,
                 shapes, pins, vias ro T's.
  NOTES
     Usually you want to use thet_fill = t. The nil optionoperates
     in its mode due to legacyconsiderations; it is used by APD applications.
     If passed a segment, it does not report inter-pathconnectitivity. Thus
     only the first and last segment of a pathreport any connectivity.
     Internal segments of a pathalways return nil. This isbecause the
     Allegro database connectivitymodel guarantees that internal segments
     are always connected to theiradjacent segments. The list of segments
     reported in a path (cline) dbid is how theindividual segments are connected.
  NEEDS
     o_dbid      - a DB dbid, path (cline), line/arc (segment), shape, pin, via or T.
     t_full      - see above
  RETURNS
     nil         - Nothing connected to o_dbid
     l_result    - List of dbids connected to o_dbid. Ifo_dbid is a
                   CLINE or SEGMENT, then
                         l_result = (<list 1st endpoint><list 2nd endpoint>)
                   where list1 = nil or elements connectedto the
                                first end
                         list2 = nil or elements connectedto the
                                second end
                   For all otherobjects returns a lists of connections.
                   If no connectionsreturns nil
