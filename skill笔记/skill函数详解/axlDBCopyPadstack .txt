  NAME
     axlDBCopyPadstack - create a newpadstack by copying from an existing
  FUNCTION
     axlDBCopyPadstack(
         o_dbid
         lt_startEnd
         [g_dontTrim]
     )
     ==> o_dbid/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This creates a new padstackfrom an existing padstack.
         The name is the newpadstack is automatically derived from
         the existing name by addinga post fix that will not collide
         with any existing names.The padstack is marked in the database
         as dervivded from itsstarting padstack.
         Start/end must be provided and must be legal ETCHlayers
         but is ignored unless g_dontTrim is t. Iftrim is enabled then
         new padstack to only havepads between the list layers.
         Trimming only restrictsresulting padstack to between the
         two indicated layers. Ifthe starting padstack does not already
         span between the 2 layers then it will not be expanded to
         fill to those layers.
  NEEDS
     o_dbid     - dbid of the padstack to copy from
     lt_startEnd - list of start (class/subclass) and stop (class/subclass) layer
     g_dontTrim  - t -> don't trim padstack, nil -> trim if necessary
  RETURNS
         - nil  if new padstack not created,
         - dbid if new padstackcreated
  EXAMPLE
     1) just derive exact copy
         newPadId = axlDBCopyPadstack(padId, '("ETCH/TOP" "ETCH/BOTTOM"))
     2) just derive and trim to onlyconnect from top to 2
         newPadId = axlDBCopyPadstack(padId, '("ETCH/TOP" "ETCH/2") t)
