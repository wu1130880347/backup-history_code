改变class/subclass优先级
  NAME
         axlLayerPrioritySet - Change prioirtyof a given class/subclass.
  FUNCTION
         axlLayerPrioritySet(
                 t_layer
                 x_priority
            ) -> t/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This changes the drawingpriority of given layer. Priority is from 1 (highest)
         to 255 lowest. Layerswithout priority in standard drawing order below
         all priority layers.  The active layer is always drawn first.
         Only one layer may be at apriority level, thus adding a newlayer
         at a priority replaces theexisting layer at that priority
                 axlLayerPrioritySet( "BOARD GEOMETRY/OUTLINE" 1)
                 axlLayerPrioritySet( "PACKAGE GEOMETRY/ASSEMBLY_TOP" 1)
         results in just theASSEMBLY_TOP being drawn at priority 1 and
         OUTLINE will return tonormal drawing order.
         From priority level 1 eachlevel must be set for lower priority
         levels to be enabled. Forexample, if you set a layerto priority level 2
         but leave level 1 empty then level 2 isdisabled until level 1 is assigned.
         Classes may be groupedtogether in a class group with one class being the lead
         of that group. For example, all etch layers (ETCH, PIN, etc.) are mapped
         together into the stack-upgroup with class ETCH the lead. You can set the
         priority using class namesbut you cannot prioritized the different stack-up
         layers individually. Thisinterface will automatically map a class name to
         to its class group (see axlLayerPriorityGet to determine groupings).
         You should do a axlVisibleUpdate(...) after changing layer priority
         to have the displayupdated.
         NOTE: priority value of 0 means remove layerpriority of the layer.
  NEEDS
         x_layer: layer name (i.e. "ETCH/TOP")
         x_priority: priority valuein the range of 1-255 and 0 means remove
  RETURNS
         t: success
         nil: error in oneof the arguments

  EXAMPLES
         Set prirority for classGEOMETRY and subclass OUTINE:
             axlLayerPrioritySet("BOARD GEOMETRY/OUTLINE" 1)
         To temporarily force a set oflayers to display on top, you
         should take the followingsteps:
             save existing layertable,
             clearexisting layer priorities
             set yourlayer priorities
             draw objects
             restore old layerpriority:
             axlLayerPrioritySaveAll()
             axlLayerPriorityClearAll()
              axlLayerPrioritySet() multiple times if needed
             axlLayerPriorityRestoreAll()
