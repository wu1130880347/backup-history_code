  NOTE
         If a group if left with nomembers,  the group is tagged for deletion
         (but will not be removed immediately).
         You do not need to explicitly remove objects from agroup before
         deleting the object (i.e. with axlDeleteObject).  The act of deleting
         an object will remove it from all groupsto which it is a member.
