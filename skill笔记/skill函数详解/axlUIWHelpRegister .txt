  FUNCTION
      This registers a help document for a user written skill command or
      form (dialog). This is typically used in conjunction with axlCmdRegister.
      You should make this call at the time you do a axlCmdRegister instead
      of waiting until the skill code associated with the command executes.
      You can also add the registrations via the help_config.txt file (see
      (<cdsroot>/share/pcb/help/help_config.txt) placed at the site or
      pcbenv directory.
      The document types (determined via file extension) supported on all platforms are:
         .txt - a plain text file displayed via Allegro's internal long message window
         .html - html browser displayed via a web browser
         .pdf - Acrobat file displayed by a Acrobat reader
       On Windows other extensions are typically supported which are determined
       by what programs are installed on the computer (e.g. doc for Word and ppt
       for PowerPoint).
  NEEDS
         t_cmd: cmd name or form.<formname> for registering help for form buttons
         t_helpFile:     document to display. Variable expansion is supported
                 so you can embed Allegro env variables to make the installed
                 location of the files relative to the variable setting.
  RETURNS
         t for success, nil for failure (invalid arguments)
