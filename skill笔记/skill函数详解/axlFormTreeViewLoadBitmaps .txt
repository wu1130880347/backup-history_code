  NAME
         axlFormTreeViewLoadBitmaps - Makes new bitmapimages available for use ina tree view
  SYNOPSIS
         axlFormTreeViewLoadBitmaps(
                 r_form
                 t_field
                 lt_bitmaps
         ) -> l_hImage/nil
  FUNCTION
         Allows an application to load one or more bitmaps intoAllegro
         for use in the specified tree view.
  NEEDS
         r_form: Form id
         t_field: Name of field
         lt_bitmaps: Either a stringcontaining the name of the bitmap
                 file to load, or a list of strings, each of which is the
                 name of a bitmapfile to load.
  NOTES
         Bitmap images must be 16 x 16 pixels.
         A bitmap file may containmore than one image provided they are
         appended horizontally (i.e. a bitmap filecontaining n images
         will be (16*n) x 16 pixels).
         The color RGB(255,0,0) is reserved for the transparentcolor.
         Any pixel with this colorwill be displayed using the background
         color.
  RETURNS
         A list of image handlesthat the caller will use to reference
         the images images insubsequent axlFormTreeViewAddItem calls.
         The list is ordered tocorrespond with the same order that
         the images were listed inthe lt_bitmaps parameter.
         nil is returned if any of the bitmapfiles could not befound,
         or if an error was encountered while adding images.
  EXAMPLE
         Say file myBmp1.bmp is a 16 x 16 bitmap and myBmp2.bmp is a
         32 x 16 bitmap.
             (axlFormTreeViewLoadBitmaps (list "myBmp1" "myBmp2"))
         might return
             (6 7 8)
         This would mean that the image handle 6 would refer to  the
         bitmap contained inmyBmp1.bmp, the image handle 7 would refer
         to the left half ofmyBmp2.bmp, and the image handle 8 would
         refer to the right half ofmyBmp2.bmp.
