  FUNCTION
         axlDBCreateExternalDRC(
            t_constraint/lt_constraint
             l_anchorPoint
             t_layer
             [lo_dbid]

         )
         ==> l_result/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Creates an externallydefined (by user) DRC containing thevalues
         given in thearguments.  An externally defined DRCmarker always
         has the two characters "X D" in it.
         You may pass the constraintas the tradition argument (t_constraint)
         where this contains both the constraint and expected value in
         a one string. The downsideof this method is that show element
         and reports will report a 0 for the exepctValue.Alternatively
         you can pass it as a list of containing twostrings; contraint
         name and expected value.This format will report properly in
         both show element and reports. Noteconstraint and expectValue
         are actually implemented aspropertyies on the external drc dbid
         whose names areEXTERNAL_VIOLATION_DESCRIPTION, EXTERNAL_DRC_VALUE.
         The t_actualValue isoptional and provides anexternally-defined
         actual value for the DRC with units.
         Attempting to create a DRCobject on a non-DRC class is an error.
         Note: This function is available in thelayout editor, but not
                 in the symboleditor.
  NEEDS
         t_constraint            - Name of the "constraint" that was violated.
                                        This string should contain both the
                                        type of constraint aswell as the
                                         "required" value and comparison.
         lt_constraint           - Alternative method it is a list of
                                 (t_constraintt_expectValue)
         l_anchorPoint           - The location of the DRC
         t_layer                 - Layer for the marker. Thiseither must
                                 include the "drc errorclass" or just
                                 thesubclass name.
         lo_dbid                 - Optional list of the objects thatcaused
                                        the DRC (maximumof two).
         l_secondPoint           - Second reference point. Make thisa
                                coordinate on the object of the DRC pair
                                 that does not have the DRC markeron it.
                                This point shows what the second object is
                                 when you read the DRC data inlater processes.
         t_actualValue           - actual (calculated) value for the constraint
  RETURNS
         l_result/nil            - nil if not created, or a list containing
                                        (car) axl DBID of the DRC
                                        (cadr) t always (in future, t if DRC
                                                is new, else nil if DRC
                                                existed already)
   EXAMPLES
         The following examplecreates a user defined DRC marker at x,y
         (1500, 1800) to mark a violationof user rule:
                 "Line toPin--MY SPACING RULE" with a required value 12
                 and actual value of 10.
         1) original method
             axlDBCreateExternalDRC(
                 "MY SpacingLine to Pin/req:12"
                 1500:1800 "drc errorclass/top" nil nil "10 MILS")
         2) new method for better show elementand report behavior
             axlDBCreateExternalDRC(
                 '("My SpacingLine to Pin" "12")
                 1500:1900 "top", nil nil "10 MILS")
         Adds "X D" DRC markers at (1500 1800) and (1500 1900).
