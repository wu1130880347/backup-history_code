  NAME
     axlDBPinPairLength - calculate length between two pins, vias or rat_ts
  SYNOPSIS
     axlDBPinPairLength(
         o_pin1
         o_pin2
     )
     ==> f_etchlength/nil
  FUNCTION
         Calculate the shortest length between 2 pins. Pins must be
         on the same xnet. The pincan also be a VIA or RAT_T. If the
         distance is not fully routedincludes a Manhatten estimate
         of the unrouted portion.
         Includes VIA-Z or PIN_DELAY in itscalculation if theseoptions
         are enabled and if your licensepermits this capability.
  NEEDS
     o_pin1      - a pin, via or rat_t
     o_pin2      - a pin, via or rat_t on same xnet as o_pin1
  RETURNS
     nil         - Not a legal object; unsupported dbidor items not on same xnet
     f_etchLength  - length of object
