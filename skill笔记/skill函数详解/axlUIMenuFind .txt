  NAME
         axlUIMenuFind - find a menu item by location or command
  SYNOPSIS
         axlUIMenuFind(
             x_menuId/nil
             t_cmdName/x_location
             [g_menuOption]
         ) ==> x_menuId/nil
  FUNCTION
         The location (x_location) is 0 based (typically the "File"
         menu item on the menubar). The 0 location is the left or
         top most menu item.  A negative number may be used to
         specify a menu counting from the right side with a -1
         indicating the menu furthest to the left or bottom.
         Two modes are possible:
         1) Find by name, finds menu item by command name.
            This method cannot find menubar items such as "File".
            When finding by name you should pass nil as the first
            argument.
         2) Find by x_location, identifies a menu item off the menubar
            (menuId = nil) or sub-menu.
         Menu searching is controlled via a menu stack. The first argument,
         x_menuId, controls the stack. For most operations, you should pass
         a nil to this argument. Typically searching via the menu stack
         would use x_location as the second argument since the t_cmdName
         method is sufficient to find commands multi-levels deep in the menu
         hierarchy.  If you have a nested search active then passing a nil will
         reset the stack. The stack is also popped if you provide a menuId
         older then the last id.
         The g_menuOption when used in location mode will return
         the top or bottom of the indexed sub-menu (see below).
  TIP   
         Examples shown below provide typical uses.
  CAUTIONS (release to release portability)
         - While not frequent, command names may change from release to release.
         - Certain products or product tiers may not have a command.
         - Menus may be reorganized so expecting to find a command on a particular
           sub-menu may not return the expected result in a new release.
         - As always adding Allegro commands or scripts to menus may require updates
           in a new release.
         - See introduction of this section on menu recommandations.
  NEEDS
         x_menuId - menuId return of previous call or nil to search from menu root.
         t_cmdName - find item by command name. This may not by just a command
            but is realy a command line (e.g.  if the command is register as
            "echo hello" then you must find by "echo hello" NOT "echo".
         x_location - find item by location. Location is 0 based so the "File"
            menu is location 0. Negative numbers may be used where -1 is the
            right-most (or bottom-most) menu item.
         g_menuOption - permitted values are 'top or 'bottom
                 If used with find by command returns the top of bottom of the
                 menu where the command exists.
                 Bottom option also indicates to axlUIMenuInsert to that a new
                 menu item should be appended to end of the menu.
                 If used with find by location and the item is a submenu returns
                 the top or bottom of that submenu.
  RETURNS
         If succesful returns a menu number else failure is
         indicated by a nil

            are equivalent (assumes add line exists on 3rd item of menubar):
