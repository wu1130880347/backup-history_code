  NAME     
         axlEnterPath - interactiveinterface to get an axlPath
  FUNCTION     
         axlEnterPath (      
             ?prompts l_prompt
             ?points  l_point
             ?lastPath r_path
             ?gridSnap g_gridSnap
         )   
         ==> t/nil     
  SYNOPSIS   
         Gets the start point and subsequent points for a path, either
         from the user, with optionalprompting, or from the optional
         argument ?points. The function sets the startpoint to the
         first value of l_points, if any, and the second point tothe
         second value, if any. If ?lastPath is given, the function
         connects the dynamicrubberband to its most recent segment.
         Use axlEnterPath recursively tobuild up the coordinates of a
          path from an interactiveuser.
  NEEDS     
         l_prompt        - List containing one prompt message.The
                         function display s this to the user.
         l_point         - list of points. If provided, point is returned.
         r_path          - a path strtucture to start thecurrent path form.
                                 Ifr_path is provided, thefirst point is
                                 forced to be theend point of r_path, even if
                                 itis provided by the user.
         g_gridSnap      - User pick or l_point is snapped to grid before
                                it's returned if g_gridSnap is set.
      
  RETURNS   
         r_path/nil: Path containingsegments constructed from the
                         combinedpoints in l_points and the user input
                         toaxlEnterPath.
  EXAMPLE     
         You use the AXL-SKILL axlCancelEnterFun and axlFinishEnterFun
         functions when you create aninteractive command that loops on
         user input, so the user canterminate the command.
         The following example doesthe following:
         1. Defines the functions axlMyCancel and axlMyDone.
         2. Defines a pop-up with thosefunctions as the callbacks for
                 user selections.Cancel and Done from thepop-up.
         3. Loops on the function axlEnterPath gathering userinput to
                 create amulti-segment line on "etch/top."
         The user terminates thecommand at any time by selecting Cancel
         or Done from the pop-up.
        (defun axlMyCancel ()
                 axlClearDynamics()
                 axlCancelEnterFun()
                 axlUIPopupSet(nil))
         (defun axlMyDone ()
                 axlClearDynamics()
                 axlFinishEnterFun()
                 axlUIPopupSet(nil))
         mypopup = axlUIPopupDefine( nil
                 (list (list "MyCancel" `axlMyCancel)
                 (list "MyDone" `axlMyDone)))
         axlUIPopupSet( mypopup)
         ; Clear the dynamic buffer
         axlClearDynamics()
         ; Clear mypath to nil, then loopgathering user picks:
         mypath = nil
         while( (mypath = axlEnterPath(?lastPath mypath))
                 progn(
                         axlDBCreatePath(mypath, "etch/top")))
         The program gathers onepick from the user and extends the
         database path by that pickduring each time around the while
         loop. The user terminatesthe loop by picking Done from the
         pop-up. The user can cancelout at any time by selecting Cancel.
          The segments added becomepermanent in the database when the
        loop terminates.
