  NAME
         axlSubSelectBox - remove items in window from sel set
  SYNOPSIS
         axlSubSelectBox(
                 [l_bBox]
         )
         ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         Find all selected objects that intersect with the input box and meet
         the find filter criteria.  Remove those objects from the selection set.
         If no box (or an incomplete box) is provided, prompt the user for
         a selection box (or to complete the box) prior to the find operation.
  NEEDS
         l_bBox  - A list containing one or two coordinates defining the
                   bounding box to be used to the select figures. If l_bBox is
                   nil, the function requests two picks from the user. If l_bBox
                   has only one point, the function asks for a second point from
                   the user.
  RETURNS
         t               - if any objects were removed from the selection set.
         nil             - if nothing removed.
  SEE ALSO
         axlAddSelectPoint
  EXAMPLES
         See the examples for axlSubSelectPoint for an example of subtracting
         from the select set, and axlAddSelectPoint for an example of using a
         box for selection.
