加载 Allegro IPF 文件到设计图中
  NAME
          axlDetailLoad - load Allegro ipf (intermediate plotfile) into design
  SYNOPSIS
         axlDetailLoad(
             t_filename
             point
             f_scale
             x_rotation
             g_mirror)
         ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         This loads a the designatedipf file (t_filename) into the current
         design at location (point), with scaling (f_scale), rotation (f_rotation)
         and mirror (g_mirror). Items are clipped to rectangleprovided a save file
         time.
         It will load the detail to theactive layer.
         NOTES:
            - scale values much lessthen 1.0 may haveunpredictable results.
  NEEDS
         t_filename - the name ofthe plot file whichcontains the detail.
         point - the location toplace the detail.
         f_scale - the scalingfactor of the details as a floating point number
                         (1.0 is no scaling). Most be greater then 0.1
         x_rotation - the rotatingangle in degrees. Rotation is restricted to integers.
         g_mirror - whether thedetail should be mirrored (t/nil.
  RETURNS
         t      - was able to load
         nil    - otherwise

  EXAMPLES
         1) Select a group of objects and load at 0,0 with doublescaling.
              - use ashSelect function in Skill examplesarea
               file = "myplt.plt"
               objs = ashSelect(nil)
