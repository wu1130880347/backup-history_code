  NAME
         axlUIWSetParent - set children's parent
  FUNCTION
         axlUIWSetParent (
             o_childWindow
             o_parentWindow/nil
         )
         ==> t / nil
  SYNOPSIS
         This sets the parent of a window. When a window is created it
         gets the main window of the application which is sufficient
         for most implementations. If you want to run blocking mode on
         a form that is lauched from another form then you should set
         the child's form parent window to be the lauched form.
         Setting the parent in addition to having blocking behave correctly
         also has these benefits:
            - if its parent is closed the the child is also closed
            - if the parent is iconify then the child is hidden
            - the child will stay on top of its parent in the window
                 stacking order.
  NEEDS
         o_childWindow   child window handle
         o_parentWindow  parent window (if nil then the main window of
                 application which is the default parent normally)
                 It also rejects if parent and child window are the same.
  RETURNS
         t       Set parent
         nil     Couldn't set parent (windows are probaly not legal)
