  NAME
         axlPathStart - create an axlPath (r_path) structure
  FUNCTION
         axlPathStart(
             l_points
             [f_width]
         )
         ==> r_path/nil
  SYNOPSIS
         Creates a new path with astartpoint and possibly one or more
         segments as specified bythe list l_points and returns the
         path dbid. You can add morestraight-line and arc segments to
         the returned r_path usingthe axlPathArc and axlPathLine
         functions described in thissection. Once r_path has all the
         segments you require, create the actualdatabase figure using
         the appropriate axlDBCreatefunction, with r_path as one of
         the arguments.
  NEEDS
        l_points:  List of n vertices, where n > 1.
                   If n = 1, r_path returns withthat single
                   vertex as itsstartpoint, but with nosegments. You
                   must subsequentlyadd at least one segment before
                   adding it to thedatabase.
                   If n > 1, r_path returns withn-1 straight-line
                   segments.
         f_width:  Width for all segments if anycreated between the
                   l_points. f_widthalso becomes the default width for
                   all additionalsegment s added to r_path using
                   axlPath functions. You canoverride this default
                   width each timeyou add a segment using an axlPath
                   function byusing its own f_width argument when you
                   invoke it.
  RETURNS
         r_path/nil:     Returns the r_path handle.
  NOTES
         This is a r_path object, but is not anAllegro dbid.
         The first point (if any) defines ther_path's start point.
         If <n> points areprovided, then<n-1> segments are defined.
         The l_points are provided in absolutecoordinates (user units).
