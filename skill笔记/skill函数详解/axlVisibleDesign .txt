NAME
         axlVisibleDesign - make entire design visible or invisible
  SYNOPSIS
         axlVisibleDesign(
                 g_makeVis           
         )
         ==>t/ni;
  FUNCTION
         Make entire design visible or invisible.
         This command does not visually change the display, since it can also
         be used in conjunction with the axlSelect command family to provide
         additional filtering of the database objects. If you wish to visually
         update the display, call axlUIWUpdate(nil) after changing the
         visibility.
  PROGRAMMING NOTE
         This routine along with axlVisibleGet and axlVisibleSet allow you to
         temporary change the visibility of the design to provide additional
         filtering capability when finding objects via the selection set. The
         programming model is
                 saveVis = axlVisibleGet()
                 axlVisibleDesign(nil)
                 ; set desired layers visible via one or more calls to
                 axlVisibleLayer(...)
                 ; set find filter for objects to find
                 axlSetFindFilter(...)
                 ; find objects by using one of the Select APIs .. example
                 axlAddSelectAll()
                 objs = axlGetSelSet()
                 ; restore visiblility
                 axlVisibileSet(saveVis)
                 ; note no need to make a call to axlVisibileUpdate because
                 ; the visisbility changes are a wash
  NEEDS
         g_makeVis       - either t or nil.
                           t = make entire design visible
                           nil = make entire design invisible
  RETURNS
         t               - on success
         nil             - incorrect g_makeVis arg
