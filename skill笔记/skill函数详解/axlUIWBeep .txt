  NAME
         axlUIWBlock - Block waiting for user input on window
  SYNOPSIS
         axlUIWBlock (
                 r_window
         )
         -> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         CAUTION: Is not compatible with the "g_nonBlock = nil" option to
                  axlFormCreate. With axlFormCreate your must set
                  a callback on the g_formAction.
         This blocks on the indicated window until it destroyed. All other
         windows are disabled. It may be called recursively unlike the
         block option to axlFormCreate.
  
         Once you enter a blocking mode you should not bring up a window
         that is non-blocking. This behavorior is not defined and is not
         supported.
  
         If you block you should set block attribute (block) in the Window Placement
         list (lt_placement) so that the title-bar shows that it is a
         blocking window.
  
         If you have a window callback registered you must allow the window
         to close since the unblock facility unblocks other windows upon
         close so that the correct window will get focus after the blocked
         window is destroyed.
         If one blocked form opens another form then the sub-form must
         also be blocking and a axlUIWSetParent done to set the
         parent of the second blocked form to be the lauching form.
  NEEDS
         r_window:       Window id.
  RETURNS
         t for success, nil for failure (window already closed or not a window)
