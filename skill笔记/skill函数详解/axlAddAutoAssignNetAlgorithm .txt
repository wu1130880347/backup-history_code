  NAME
     axlAddAutoAssignNetAlgorithm
  FUNCTION
     axlAddAutoAssignNetAlgorithm(t_algorithmt_displayName)
         ==> t/nil
  SYNOPSYS
     This function allows the user toadd custom auto
     net assignment algorithms tothe list in the
         Logic -> Auto Assign Net
     command's algorithms list in the APD and SIP IC Packaging
     tools. This list will always containthe Cadence standard
     algorithms (Router-Based, Nearest Match, and Constraint-Driven).
     These names cannot be duplicateor overwritten by thecustomer.
     Specifying a pair with either aduplicate algorithm or
     display name will cause thecurrently-existing (user)
     entrey to be replaced.
  NEEDS
     t_algorithm - Text string (case sensitive) containing the name
                   of the skill function to be called for this
                   algorithm.
         The function must take twoparameters:
             First parameter: Listof source pins.
             Second parameter: Listof destination pins.
         The function should return "FAIL" if it was unable tocomplete
         due to some manner of codefailure, or else should return a
         list of source pins that are stillunassigned.
     t_displayName -- Text string (also case sensitive) that will
                      be used as the name of thisalgorithm in the
                      auto assignnet command's pull-down menu for
                      selecting thealgorithm to use.
  RETURNS
     t if algorithm successfully registered.
     nil if registration failed (function not defined, name in use, etc).
  NOTES
     This function is only availablewithin the Cadence IC Packaging
     tools(APD and CDNSIP).
