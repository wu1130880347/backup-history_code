设置表格父样式
  NAME
     axlSpreadsheetSetStyleParent
  FUNCTION
     axlSpreadsheetSetStyleParent(parent)
         ==> t / nil
  SYNOPSIS
     Sets the active style's parent. Style will inherit default properties
     from its parent style, therefore only changes need to be specified
     in the child style. Parent must already be defined for spreadsheet.
  NEEDS
     parent -- Style ID of parent to link to. Note that the parent must
               already be defined before it can be referenced by children.
  RETURNS
     t   -- Style parent successfully set.
     nil -- Parent not set (no active style or parent style doesn't exist).
            See console for further details.
