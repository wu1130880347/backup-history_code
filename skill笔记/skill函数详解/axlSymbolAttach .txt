  NAME
         axlSymbolAttach - Assign an object to a symbol instance
  SYNOPSIS
         axlSymbolAttach(
                 o_symInstDbid
                 o_dbid/lo_dbid
         )
         ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         Attaches an object or list of objects to symbol instance.
         For etch objects, provides the ability to associate pin escapes with
         a symbol.
         Attach/detach rules:
             - For detaching, object must be linked to the symbol instance provided.
               For attaching, the object can't be linked to any other symbol.
             - If text appears of a REFDES class, it can't be linked or unlinked
             - Linking or unlinking non-etch objects cause them to be deleted
               or duplicated if refresh symbol is run. Etch objects is more fully
               supported by refresh sysbol.
             - CLINES, LINES, SHAPES, RECTS, FRECTS and TEXT are supported with
               the layer limits noted below:
               - Items on BOUNDARY class items are NOT supported.
               - Shapes cannot be dynamic or generated from a dynamic shape.
               - Objects cannot be on the DRC class.
  CAUTION
         Running refresh_symbol may result in deletion of design level attachments.
  NEEDS
         o_symInstDbid   - symbol instance
         o_dbid - dbid to assign to symbol
         lo_dbid - lsit of dbid to assign to symbol
  RETURNS
         t       - was able to change object
         nil     - otherwise

  EXAMPLES
         Examples use ashOne which is a shareware utility that allows user to select
         an object (see <cdsroo>/share/pcb/examples/skill/ash-fxf/ashone.il)
         - Attach an object to a symbol:
             symdbid = ashOne("SYMBOLS")
             dbid = ashOne("NOALL")
             ret = axlSymbolAttach(symdbid dbid)
