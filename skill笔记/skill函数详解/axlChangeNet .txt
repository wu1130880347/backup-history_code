  NAME
         axlChangeNet - change net anobject is on
  SYNOPSIS
         axlChangeNet(
                 o_dbid
                 t_netName/o_netdbid
         )
         ==> t/nil
  FUNCTION
         This changes the net anobject is currently on. It is currently
         restricted to shapes, filled rectangles, pins, and vias. If it
         succeeds it returns "t". It will not ripup clines or vias.
         It can fail for the followingreasons.
                 - object is not supported
                 - netName does not exist
         
         Restrictions:
                 - Pins must beassigned. Pins must have an associated
                   component.Mechanical pins are un-assigned.
                 - Vias netassignment is advisory. The via must be able to
                   connect tosomething on the provided net to remain on
                   that netotherwise it will fall back to the original
                   or possibly anothernet.  
                  
                   If a via is inopen space it will be on dummy net. This
                   API cannot beused to force it onto a net.
                   This API isuseful for a via, if a it touchsmultiple
                   shapes but it isassigned to the wrong shape's net.
         Side effects:
              1) It may not properly reconnect two touching clines
                 segments that werepreviously connected via the shape.
              2) clines onlyattached to the shape will inherit the new
                 net of the shape
              3) vias attached tothe shape will NOT inherit the new net.
                 This is differentfrom the Allegro change net command.
  NEEDS

         t_netName/o_netdbid - nameof a net or a netdbid (for dummy nets)
  RETURNS
         t      - was able to change object
         nil    - otherwise
